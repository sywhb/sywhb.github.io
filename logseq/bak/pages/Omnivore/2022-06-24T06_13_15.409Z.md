	          > Having already painted a picture of Donald Trump allegedly directing or at the very least being keenly aware of a wide-ranging plan to subvert the 2020 US presidential election, the Jan. 6 committee on Thursday moved to depict how the former president and his aides sought to use the formidable authority of the Department of Justice to keep him in power. Key to this unprecedented endeavor, the committee argued, was a letter written by a midlevel environmental lawyer—to be signed by top Justice Department officials—falsely claiming election fraud in swing states. The unsent letter, electronic message evidence and testimony by senior members of the Trump Justice Department combined today to describe what panel members said was a desperate effort to erase the election of Joe Biden and keep Trump at the head of the American government. The strategy, according to Select Committee Chair and Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson, was to help Trump “steal an election he already lost.”

	          > In a keynote at PyCon 2022 in Salt
	  Lake City, Utah, Peter Wang introduced another entrant in the field of
	  in-browser Python interpreters.  The Python community has long sought a way
	  to be able to write Python—instead of JavaScript—to run in web browsers, and there
	  have been various efforts to do so over the years.  Wang announced PyScript as a new framework, built atop
	  one of those earlier projects, to allow
	  Python scripting directly within the browser; those programs have access to
	  much of the existing Python ecosystem as well as being able to interact
	  with the browser document object model (DOM) directly. 
	  In addition, he gave some rather eye-opening demonstrations as part of the talk.

	          > Moderna, which along with Pfizer-BioNTech led the way in producing mRNA vaccines against the novel coronavirus, announced some progress in the next generation of shots that could address the wildfire-like contagiousness of the omicron strain of Covid-19. The company said its omicron-targeting vaccine triggered the production of antibodies against its newest variants, though the immune response was less robust than seen with the original version of omicron. In the US, the Biden administration has been pleading with Congress to free up funding so the latest vaccines will be available when cold weather returns and booster efficacy fades. With America’s political divide hampering both new vaccine funding and the inoculation of young children, its latest wave as measured by hospitalization continues to rise. Globally, omicron is still driving surges in China and Singapore, which saw a 23% week-on-week increase. —David E. Rovella

	          > BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2022-06-22 We: If I were Marc Andreesen, I would say this: "You, Tyler Cowen, are an example of a person doing a podcast. You are comfortable enough, with several sources of income, and do not care much about monetizing your podcast in a serious way. But in that you are anonymous. Most of the people who in a good future would be making podcasts and so adding value, knowledge, and entertainment to the world will not do so unless they can monetize it in some way. At the moment we are split into two intermets. The first is a "Web1" Internet, in which the expectation is for free and so people are strongly resistant to making micro payments and so nobody makes any money. The second is a “Web2” internet, in which big companies have figured out how to do some monetization, and have capitalized on this to create walled gardens—thus greatly disrupting the scope and reach of the network—in which they grab the lion’s share of the money for themselves, thus restricting the number of those who can afford to create: the Facebooks, Googles, Apples, and so forth. Podcasting is, if things continue as they have, headed for a future in which some get sucked into the walled gardens, in which those podcasters who hit the celebrity-reinforcement loop get rich, in which “Web2” companies profit enormously, and in which a very large chunk of those who in a good world would be members of the long tail making a reasonable living have to drop out, and only those truly driven to communicate or with alternate comfortable means have the freedom to be able to afford to podcast. We “Web3” people want a different future for podcasting. And at the heart of that will be a web of identity and network connections and trusted payments that is not the property of any single walled-garden entity that is a wannabee monopolist, but is the common creation of the community as a whole." That is what I would say if I were Marc Andreessen in the video below.What does this vision of “Web3” that I think Marc Andreessen should have laid out in his conversation with Tyler Cowen tell us about the proper value of BitCoin today? It says: the proper value of BitCoin today is zero. Ownership of BitCoin today gives you no property rights over the useful BlockChain databases that will underpin the community-owned web of identity and network connections and trusted payments that is the heart of the good Web3 future. Indeed, to imagine that you will be able to grab huge amounts of money from the l BlockChain databases that will underpin the community-owned web of identity and network connections and trusted payments in the good Web3 future is to make a category mistake: it is Web2 thinking. Nothing will give you property rights over the useful BlockChain databases that will underpin the community-owned web of identity and network connections and trusted payments that is the heart of the good Web3 future. If something would, than it would not be the good Web3 future. Yes, this poses “challenges” for Andreessen-Horwitz’s crypto-Web3 business model. Perhaps that is why he did not say it…

Trump’s followers harassed and threatened violence against state officials who were unwilling to bend, as well as their spouses, children, mothers and even grandmothers, according to the testimony.

	          > A US recession seemed avoidable even earlier this month. But central banks that fell behind the curve as prices skyrocketed are scrambling to catch up, and the Fed under Chair Jerome Powell raised interest rates aggressively this week. Even the Swiss National Bank jumped on the bandwagon. Now Bloomberg Economics models indicate odds of a recession by 2024 have jumped to at least 72%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell into bear markets, all of which may bode ill for President Joe Biden in the next election. This despite consumers being flush with cash and jobless rates remaining near historic lows. While an economic contraction and higher unemployment might be what it takes to finally ease inflation, there are some factors the Fed can’t control.

	          > The US Federal Reserve’s historic if belated war on inflation is already yielding some significant results, and while they’re arguably part of the plan, the fallout means consumer and corporate pain in the immediate term. Credit-card rates have soared past 20%, mortgage costs have climbed to the highest since 2008 and companies are having a harder time borrowing. Economists are still debating if the Fed’s battle against high prices will cause a recession, with President Joe Biden contending it isn’t the fait accompli panicky Wall Street CEOs say it is. At least those rising mortgage rates have a silver lining: The waiting lists for new houses in hot locales are gone. Homebuilders, surprised by suddenly cooling demand, are doing something they haven’t done in years: slashing prices. —David E. Rovella

	          > The bipartisan Congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection turned its attention on Thursday to former Vice President Mike Pence, whose central role in preventing what the committee called an attempted coup by Donald Trump echoed across much of the day’s testimony. The hearing depicted an increasingly ominous campaign by Trump to pressure Pence to illegally block the transfer of power to Joe Biden. Evidence presented by committee members illustrated with stark detail the alleged violent intent of some Trump followers—stirred up by Trump’s speech and social media postings—and how on Jan. 6 some came within 40 feet of Pence as he fled. But just as darkly, testimony by Greg Jacob, who was Pence’s chief counsel, and J. Michael Luttig, a conservative legal icon and former federal appellate judge, focused on another man—Trump lawyer John Eastman. Eastman was one of the alleged architects of what the committee called Trump’s plan to stay in power, proposing ways in which Pence could violate the Constitution to Trump’s benefit, witnesses said. (Eastman repeatedly invoked his right against self-incrimination at his deposition.) As the hearing ended, Luttig—who called Trump a “clear and present danger” to American democracy—was asked to reflect on what lay ahead. His response: “The former president, his allies and supporters pledge that in the presidential election of 2024, if the former president or his anointed successor as the Republican Party presidential candidate were to lose that election, that they would attempt to overturn that 2024 election in the same way they attempted to overturn the 2020 election—but succeed in 2024 where they failed in 2020.”  —David E.

	          > The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points—the biggest increase since 1994—and Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank could go that much next month, too, in what increasingly looks like a pitched battle against inflation. Initially slammed for not anticipating the fastest price gains in four decades (“transitory” now being a dirty word) and then for being too slow to respond, the Fed on Wednesday brought out heavy artillery in its bid to cool prices. As for the prospect of a soft landing, even the Fed conceded that the US economy’s eventual touchdown may be a bit bumpier than previously hoped for. In other words, stow those tray tables. —David E. Rovella

	          > The same traders whose fear of the Fed sent markets hurtling into bear territory Monday are girding for a long dark night as stocks head for their longest slide in months. Investors are keen to see whether the central bank, which meets tomorrow, gives any indication as to whether it will raise rates at a faster clip. Stocks notwithstanding, President Joe  Biden touted the humming US economy with its low unemployment, saying the powerful recovery from the pandemic recession will become more evident when inflation subsides. “I truly believe we made extraordinary progress by laying a new foundation for our economy,” Biden said Tuesday at a meeting of the AFL-CIO, the biggest US labor confederation. In addition to tapping the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to address high gas prices and working with European partners on plans to get Ukrainian grain to market, Biden cited proposals aimed at bringing down the cost of child care and prescription drugs and said the wealthiest Americans must “pay their fair share” in taxes. “I have a plan to bring down the cost of gas and food,” he said, seeking to position the Democratic Party for the coming midterm elections, but adding “it’s going to take time.” In Europe,​​ a new survey by economists shows many expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates  faster and further than anticipated just a month ago as it battles the highest inflation in decades. As for all those investors out there watching their portfolios shrink, remember not to panic. Here’s your  markets wrap.  —Margaret Sutherlin

	          > BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2022-06-13 Mo: Friedrich von Hayek said “the market giveth, the market taketh away, blessed be the name of the market”. John Maynard Keynes whimpered that if only governments allowed his technocratic students to conduct a sensible monetary policy along with a "somewhat comprehensive" socialization of investment things could be managed. Karl Polanyi said that the "stark utopia" of von Hayek's market was unsustainable: people insisted that the market was made for man, not man for the market”. The closest the whole thing came to holding together was the post-WWII era of social democracy, in which Keynesian focus on full employment (and low interest rates to make amortizing the WWII-era debt easy), Beveridgian equality-through-redistribution (and public provision), plus a little Pigovian externality-compensation produced the Thirty Glorious Years and enforced a shotgun marriage between von Hayek and Polanyi. But somehow social democracy failed its sustainability test, and was replaced by neoliberalism, which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it would make the rich much richer and give them much more social power...

	          > With a deafening roar, the US stock market ran headlong into bear territory, the S&P sinking 20% below a January peak and hitting its lowest mark since the previous January. Tech shares bore the brunt of the Monday rout, with the Nasdaq 100 slumping about 4.5%. Speculative areas of the market inflated by years of government largesse buckled as profitless software firms, newly public companies and blank-check entities were unceremoniously dumped. Credit markets continued their historic repricing of rate trajectories: Treasury 10-year yields climbed to the highest since 2011 while two-year rates jumped to levels last seen before the 2008 financial crisis. The cost to protect investment-grade debt from default soared as a closely watched segment of the US bond curve inverted. And Bitcoin took another dive, tumbling to its lowest point in about 18 months after withdrawals tied to the Celsius lending platform were frozen. Only the dollar provided some respite. With the Federal Reserve positioned for an assault on high inflation fueled in part by Russia’s war and supply chain chaos, Victoria Greene, chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, said the bottom is still a ways off. “It’s going to get a little uglier,” —Natasha Solo-Lyons

Nobody believes that the best use of land is the one that passes the maximum profitability test in the eyes of distant rootless cosmopolites. This does not mean that NIMBYism is a sensible reaction. It is not. But it is a guide to where NIMBYism gets its energy...

	          > Prospects for global growth or the potential for a US recession seem to depend on who you ask. Outspoken corporate leaders from Jamie Dimon to Elon Musk are intensifying warnings about US inflation, which hit a fresh 40-year high in May, as well as impending interest rate hikes. But most economists still argue a contraction is unlikely in the immediate future. That’s little consolation for Americans dealing with spiking costs for the basics like food, utilities and energy. Avocado prices led inflation in Mexico last month, while gasoline in the US hovers near a once-unthinkable $5 per gallon. The Federal Reserve is walking a tight rope trying to cool off the economy without crashing it, but there’s still hope for a soft landing, John Authers writes in Bloomberg Opinion.

	          > The first public hearing of the Congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol left no doubt as to its position on who was responsible. House members labeled the deadly attempt to block the transfer of power an “attempted coup” and said it was the bloody culmination of a seven-part plan that began before the 2020 election—a plan ultimately moved forward by one person. The bipartisan committee alleged criminal acts by Donald Trump and his aides, punctuating arguments with gruesome video of his followers doing violence to Capitol police, along with similarly powerful witness testimony. With more public hearings scheduled through the month, the world is likely to get more insight into the events of that day and other facets of a purportedly wide-ranging bid to subvert American democracy. But Congress cannot prosecute federal crimes—that’s the job of the Department of Justice. Its unprecedented nationwide probe continues to slowly accumulate arrests, guilty pleas, cooperators and convictions. As Congress completes its report, all eyes will turn to Attorney General Merrick Garland, and the course of his inquiry into an alleged seditious conspiracy. —David E. Rovella

The Jan. 6, 2021, attack, in which followers of Donald Trump sought to block the transfer of power to Joe Biden, led to Trump’s unprecedented second impeachment. Timothy L. O’Brien writes in Bloomberg Opinion that labels like attack or riot won’t do to describe that day: It was nothing other than an attempted coup.

One is a fresh bond selloff thanks to high inflation and the other a sustained rally that sends yields back to historic lows on—you guessed it—recession fears. That much-predicted future downturn has become a common refrain in financial and media circles. With the echo chambers bouncing the word around at ever-higher decibels, a Nobel laureate economist says there’s a “good chance” one will happen in part because everyone—investors, companies, consumers—is so worried about it. —David E.

It would also be good news for the Federal Reserve as it seeks a soft landing, though on Tuesday Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she expects inflation to remain high for now. But for many other countries, the horizon remains much darker, according to World Bank President David Malpass. “The world economy is again in danger,” he said as the bank cut its forecast for economic expansion in 2022. Malpass warned that several years of above-average inflation and below-average growth—or stagflation—lie ahead, with potentially destabilizing consequences for the less wealthy economies of the world. —Margaret Sutherlin

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was prevented from visiting Serbia after that country’s neighbors banned his flight from their airspace. The UK plans to follow America’s lead and send rocket systems to Ukraine that will let it strike as far as 50 miles (80 km) away. The Biden administration declined to provide Ukraine with longer-range missiles and said Kyiv pledged not to use the new systems to strike inside Russia. Vladimir Putin has threatened to hit new, unspecified targets if longer-range missiles are delivered. —Natasha Solo-Lyons

The US had been seeking to pivot toward Asia (China in particular) over the past decade. But now the Biden administration’s high-level, long-term assessment is being formally reworked with Kremlin aggression in mind, and an approach that links Europe and Asia. As for the war in Ukraine, some of Putin’s backers think his attempt to seize victory in the Donbas from the jaws of a larger defeat—by triggering a global food crisis and more inflation—may actually work. —David E.

Business payrolls increased by only 128,000 last month, held back by a decline in small firm employment. US stocks however snapped a two-day slide to rally ahead of Friday’s non-farm payroll report, as traders expect to see cooler labor demand, something the Federal Reserve might consider good news in its fight against inflation.

	          > From 2015: My suspicion is that Parsa was close enough to southern Mesopotamia and also close enough to Iranian pastures. They were thus able to figure out how to tax that densely-populated irrigated-farming population of southern Mesopotamia. And at the same time they were able to figure out how to use the horse-mounted herders of the Iranian pasture. Add in the growing size of then-modern larger horse. And they had an advantage in communications, in mobility, in the use of the bow, and in the use of the rider for combat. They thus brought the age of iron and horse to the fertile crescent, and did so in a way that had not been possible in the age of bronze and chariot, or even iron and chariot. But I do not know, I do not claim to know, and I have not found anybody who does know. Nor do we know why the empire held together, save that it repeatedly almost did not. And, of course, the rule of the Loyal-Spirit Great Kings of Iran is followed by something even more extraordinary. At the end of the Haxamanishya Empire there is what is probably best-called its LBO, by Alexander the Great of Macedon, and then by his marshals who became his successors.

	          > The European Union is trying to complete a sixth sanctions package targeting Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, but the debate is ongoing as Hungary wants yet another change—this one involving lifting sanctions against a Russian religious figure close to Vladimir Putin. The measures, announced earlier this week, include a partial Russian oil ban and removing Russia’s biggest bank from the SWIFT international payments system. Meanwhile, Biden administration officials are divided over how much further the US can push sanctions without sparking global economic instability and fracturing trans-Atlantic unity. The EU is also working to coordinate a ban on providing the insurance services needed to ship Russian oil anywhere in the world, a move that could badly hurt Moscow’s ability to finance its war. In Ukraine, Russian troops have seized more than two-thirds of the city of Sievierodonetsk in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region. And new US-provided missile systems for Kyiv have triggered warnings from the Kremlin. —Natasha Solo-Lyons

	          > BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2022-06-01 We: I have long been fascinated by the Achaemenid Persian Empire of -550 to -320. And I have just finished a very good book: Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones: Persians: The Age of the Great Kings <https://www.amazon.com/dp/1472277287/>, about the Achaemenid Persian Empire. The book is chock-full of wonderfully fascinating facts, connections, and interpretations of what was going on in the Near East in the Achaemenid Persian age. I recommend it highly. Yet it has been a long time since I read a book in which the text so undermined the proclaimed moral point-of-view of the book. The proclaimed point-of-view is, basically, that Greeks have lied about the Persians—created a discourse of “Orientalism” designed to “represent… the ‘colonies’ and cultures of the Middle Eastern world in a way that would justify and support the West’s colonial enterprise…”. Greeks painted Persian as “a fantastical land of mystery, dark shadows, places of intrigue, despotic rulers, enslaved women, and wealth beyond imagination…”, a place of “decadence, luxury, and a certain backwardness of thought…” But this was “a European invention… of romance, exotic beings, haunting memories and landscapes, remarkable experiences…”. It is time, he says, to move away from an invented “Oriental” landscape in which: The Great Kings are… lustful, capricious, mad tyrants, and the empire is regarded as an oppressive challenge to the Greek ideals of ‘freedom’ (whatever that meant)… the Persians… [are] cowardly, scheming, effeminate, vindictive, and dishonourable…. the epitome of barbarianismIt is time, he says, to present the “Persian Version” of history. But the problem is that the book then tells—credits—stories in which: the Persian Achaemenid Emperors are lustful and capricious (if not quite mad); the Persian Empire is an oppressive challenge to all who think that absolutist monarchy without any semblance of due process is a thing on the menu they would rather not order; and the Persians—at least the Persian élite—are scheming, vindictive, and dishonorable (if no more cowardly or effeminate than the standard). So I left the book thinking, rather, that more was at stake in the three battles of Marathon, Salamis, and Plataea than I had previously thought. I left the book thinking more strongly that each day was a good day in which the tide of absolute monarchy and casually murderous politics was pushed back by ideas of rule-of-law, due process, and obedience-to-the-laws-we-prescribe-to-ourselves. And I left the book thinking that when Llewellyn-Jones claims that:Nothing is reported of Xerxes, Artaxerxes III, Bagoas, or Parysatis which does not find ready parallels in well-attested information about Henry VIII, Ivan IV (the Terrible), or Wu Zetian…he is saying something that is (a) false, and (b) not to the point. To the extent that we want to proclaim ourselves adopted children of the Athenians, it is not because we see them as precursors of Henry VIII “The Six-Wived” Tudor or of Ivan IV “The Dreaded” Rurik.Now do not get me wrong. I do like and respect the achievements of the Achaemenid Empire. The Pax Persica was a wonderful thing for the Near East <https://delong.typepad.com/delong_long_form/2015/08/musings-on-thomas-malthus-the-hellenistic-age-the-loyal-spirit-great-kings-of-iran-550-330-bce-and-other-topics-the-hones.html>. The artisans and artists are stunning. Their view of a cosmopolitan world was far ahead of its time—even if it was only of a world ruled by one tribe, the Persians, and one dynasty, the Haxamanishya, and one guy in the dynasty, the emperor.Nevertheless, the story of the Achaemenid Empire as it comes down to us greatly reinforces the following lessons:There are great benefits to a government of limited powers that must follow procedures.There are great benefits to a society in which people have rights, and are not just all slaves of the Great King to be tortured and murdered at his pleasure, or just because he is having a bad day.“Freedom” is not just something to put in scare quotes and dismiss with a “whatever that meant”.The imperial Persian court was a shitshow.It was a shitshow from the moment that Darius I overthrew the legitimate Emperor Bardiya, and then claimed that he—Darius—(a) never lied, (b) was the Servant of Holy Truth, and that (c) the real Bardiya had actually been killed earlier by a shape-shifting magician.Perhaps it was a shitshow even before then…

He also emphasized that, though fighting price increases remains his top priority, that work is primarily the purview of the central bank. “My plan is to address inflation. That starts with a simple proposition: respect the Fed, respect the Fed’s independence, which I have done and will continue to do,” Biden said. On Tuesday, markets ended May almost exactly where they started, with a late-session drop depositing the S&P 500 less than a point higher than its level a month ago.

	          > A diminished National Rifle Association went ahead with its gun industry convention this weekend as more grim details emerged about the mass shooting that claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas. Texas police agencies sought to defend against public fury over their delay in confronting the gunman—and the young lives it may have cost—with a series of sometimes contradictory explanations. These included that local police believed the assailant was barricaded alone—despite 911 calls from children begging for help from the classroom. Across the state in Houston, the NRA convention went on amid protests, though the company that made the rifle used in the massacre bowed out, as did other speakers and entertainers. Even Governor Greg Abbott, a staunch gun advocate, was to appear only on video. Among the few well-known figures speaking in person to the gun lobby was Donald Trump. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden and his wife are to travel to Uvalde on Sunday to meet with the families of those murdered this week.

	          > Texas state and local police are under siege for their shifting explanations as to why they stood by for an hour and 18 minutes as a gunman shot 21 people dead, including 19 children, inside an elementary school classroom. Heavily armed federal agents reportedly arrived much earlier than previously stated by Texas police, but were prevented by them from entering the school. When asked why a crowd of law enforcement officers gathered outside the school in Uvalde, Texas, didn’t move in earlier, one Texas police official explained that they “could’ve been shot.” Later, police said they thought the gunman was barricaded by himself inside the school, though students calling 911 indicated otherwise. By the end of Friday, Texas police admitted to making the “wrong decision.” Steven McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said: “If I thought it would help, I would apologize.” —David E.

	  We all know how valuable APIs are. They’re the gateway to exploring other
	  services, integrating with them, and building great solutions faster.
	  
	  You might have built or are thinking of building APIs for other developers to
	  use. An API needs some form of authentication to provide authorised access to
	  the data it returns.
	  
	  There are several authentication standards available today such as API Keys,

	          > Vladimir Putin just made an offer to the world, one that may illustrate how badly international sanctions are biting Russia. The Kremlin leader said he’s willing to smooth the way for grain and fertilizer exports as global shortages mount—but only if sanctions on his isolated nation are lifted. Putin didn’t specify if he was referring to Russian exports or  those from Ukraine that have been stopped (or reportedly stolen) by his military as it wages war on that country. The White House swiftly rejected Putin’s quid pro quo. In Russia, the central bank delivered its third interest-rate reduction in just over a month and said borrowing costs can  fall further still, halting a rally in the ruble as it unwinds the financial defenses in place since the invasion began. The pace of ruble losses quickened after the announcement, heading for a two-day slump that’s approaching 12% against the dollar. On the ground in Ukraine, Kyiv’s troops in the eastern Luhansk region are coming under constant shelling from Russians who now occupy about 95% of the territory, Ukrainian officials said. There are more than 40,000 civilians in the parts of Luhansk still under Ukrainian control, including 15,000 in the town of Sievierodonetsk. The fighting, said Ukraine Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar, has reached “maximum intensity.” —David E. Rovella

Expressions of sympathy from opponents of reform, deemed by gun-control advocates hollow at best (the expression “thoughts and prayers” coming in for acid derision), also earned wide condemnation on social media. Ten years after another group of children were shot dead in Connecticut, and with multiple mass killings in between, Republican Party leaders were showing no sign that the latest slaughter—in a state with some of the least restrictive gun laws in America—would lead to new legislation.

	          > Listen now | Noah Smith & Brad DeLong Record the Podcast We, at Least, Would Like to Listen to!; Aspirationally Pseudo-...Sp,eto,e; Aspirationally Less than 60 Minutes: Key Insights: 1. The most recent round of Tech elephants, rhinoceroses, unicorns, and spiny lizards—Netflix, Shopify, etc.—are very unlikely to payoff for those investors who stay on the ride to the very end. 2. That said, they were very much worth doing even if they never make their shareholders any money. The growth of communities of engineering, entrepreneurial, and organizational practice is a huge benefit for innovation and growth—and the overwhelming bulk of that becomes non-rival public knowledge, that nobody can make scarce and hence charge people through the nose for. 3. Having your rich and your superrich fund R&D for little return is not the worst thing to have happen. 4. The ideas behind “Web3”—an end to the walled-garden Web2 internet, with the useful parts of the social graph trustable and publicly accessible to anyone who wants to communicate—are great ones. 5. The ideas behind “Web2”—the clickbait-ad walled-gardens—are horrible. And it is not just Facebook and Twitter. Google and Amazon are manifestly less useful to me than they were a decade and a half ago. Why? Because using pixels to inform me is less profitable than using them for selling ads, and the companies have decided to be evil. 6. Code is fundamental: a tech-finance drought is no reason not to learn to code. It is a reason to get a job working for a company that already has a real product, and, you know, profits. 7. At bottom, all of “crypto” is very familiar. It is taking out a map, drawing property lots boundaries on them, and then trying to sell those lots to people by telling them that the railroad is coming through. And in the end everyone will be very happy If the railroad does come through, and does not decide to build its river-crossing bridge ten miles north. 8.Hexapodia!

	          > Fourteen students and one teacher were killed in a mass shooting at an elementary school in Texas on Tuesday. The shooter, said by authorities to be an 18-year-old man who lived in the community, was killed by police at the scene. The Robb Elementary School in Uvalde is about 85 miles west of San Antonio and roughly 75 miles from the Mexico border. The shooting recalls the December 2012 killing of 26 people, mostly young children, at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newton, Connecticut, which mobilized anti-gun violence advocates around the country. Tuesday’s attack is the second mass shooting in less than two weeks in America. A White gunman killed 10 Black shoppers and employees in a Buffalo, New York, supermarket on May 14 in what officials have called a hate crime. —Margaret Sutherlin

I found myself looking at Tesla’s stock price: after all, “crypto” today appears highly correlated in its stock market valuation with “tech”, and Tesla is now looking like a tech-factor stock rather than a manufacturing-factor stock. That is, Tesla is trading as if it is constructing a walled garden within which it will then leverage a piece of software written once that runs everywhere and harvests the activity of its users for some chain of actions vague in the middle that ends with “PROFITS LARGE FOREVER!”. It is not trading like a company whose profits depend on large-scale efficient execution of manufacturing processes—a company that makes large things out of metal using technologies for which the knowledge is widely distributed...

And US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said 20 nations have agreed to send more security assistance to Ukraine, including Harpoon anti-ship missile and artillery systems. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking to the World Economic Forum in Davos, said it remains critical that Russia’s economy be shut off from the world—and that global investors shift resources to Ukraine to help rebuild the country. —Natasha Solo-Lyons

But reading books works for me. For example, my wife says I spend more time talking to, say, Barry Eichengreen in the shower than I do in person. And his office is just down the hall. And, you know, indeed: <madeline_kahn_voice>it’s twue, it’s twue</madeline_kahn_voice>. I read one of Barry’s books. I look at black squiggles on a white page. And from them, I then spin-up something. What is it? As best as I can describe it, it is a sub-Turing instantiation of Barry’s mind. I then run that sub-Turing instantiation on a partition in my wetware. And I argue with it—him—whatever. I am not strange. (OK. I am not that strange.)

Wall Street—having gotten used to easy money and strong balance sheets—lurched lower this week while Target and Walmart earnings reflected higher supply costs and slower consumer spending. The latter however presents a flip side to the grim tidings: Falling demand for goods would alleviate some labor and supply chain pressures, in turn tamping down key ingredients of inflation. And declining stocks could drive some people back to the labor market. Conor Sen asks in Bloomberg Opinion: “Isn’t this exactly what we wanted?”

	          > Tesla is limping to the finish line, as the stock’s 14% decline this week makes it the second-biggest drag on the S&P 500 Index over the past five sessions, behind only Apple. The issues facing the embattled electric-vehicle maker’s stock are wide ranging: For starters, Tesla’s difficulties in China have become impossible to ignore, with multiple Wall Street analysts warning about the country’s disruptions weighing on Tesla results. The company’s shares have also been caught up in the growth-stock selloff as investors shun risky assets amid soaring inflation. And the ostensible icon of green technology managed to get itself booted from a key ESG stock index, thanks to labor and vehicle safety allegations. Then there’s its voluble billionaire co-founder. Elon Musk’s public waffling over his controversial $44 billion bid to buy Twitter, and its implications for Tesla’s finances, has roiled the waters for the carmaker. And now there are even more problems coming courtesy of its CEO. —David E. Rovella

At the same time, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said officials have discussed secondary sanctions and other ways to limit Russia’s oil revenues while minimizing the impact on energy prices during a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven countries. President Joe Biden on Thursday offered his “strong support” for bids by Finland and Sweden to join NATO as he met their leaders in Washington. NATO’s secretary general said he was hopeful the applications could soon be accepted despite initial opposition from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Biden also welcomed congressional passage of $40 billion in aid for Ukraine and announced a new package of weapons to be sent “directly to the front lines.” —David E. Rovella

	          > US consumers are shifting their spending from merchandise to services, a worrying trend for retailers that spent the past two years profiting from a pandemic spending binge. And while the development may be a promising sign for snarled supply chains and inflation, on Wednesday Wall Street was focused on the more immediate damage being wrought by higher costs. US stocks posted their biggest daily drop in almost two years, sending the S&P 500 down 4%, with a plunge in consumer shares surpassing 6%. Target Corp. plummeted more than 20% in its worst rout since 1987 after cutting its profit forecast. Walmart and Macy’s were sucked into the vortex as well. “Disappointing quarterly numbers from retail giants Target and Lowe’s are striking fear into the market,” says Fiona Cincotta at City Index. “The data yesterday suggests that consumers are weathering the inflation hit for now. Retailers, however, are not doing so well at navigating through soaring input costs.” —David E. Rovella

Now Putin says Russia’s “response” to them joining NATO would come if the two Nordic nations expand their “military infrastructure.” As Finland and Sweden are preparing to deliver their formal applications to join the military alliance, European Union members continue their struggle to impose sanctions on Russian oil, with Hungary’s Viktor Orban blocking progress. On Monday, there was no sign of a breakthrough as foreign ministers sent the issue back to ambassadors for further negotiations. In the meantime, the EU said gas importers in the bloc could continue paying for Russian fuel without breaking sanctions. —Natasha Solo-Lyons

Asking for Matt Yglesias… “The Fed… should have started moving to tighter money sooner.” To get from a description of what happened in the world to an evaluation of an actor’s actions—to get to that should—you need three things: A metric mapping outcome-states-of-the-world onto their desirability (either their desirability in the eyes of the actor or in the eyes of some impartial spectator, depending on the scope of that "should). A counterfactual as to what would have been the outcome-state-of-the-world had the actor in fact done what you say they should have done. A switch telling us whether this is a look-back or a look-forward should: Is it an ex-ante should—the actor had or did not have but could have gathered the information to let them conclude that the counterfactual world would have been a better outcome-state than what actually happened? Or is it merely a look-back ex-post should: given what was later revealed (but that the actor at the time did not know and could not have learned then) it would have been better to take the counterfactual action? I don’t see any of those anywhere in Matt’s argument. It is true that he is not an economist, and was not an economics major, and was not even a social studies major. But these counterfactual, evaluation-framework, and potential-knowledge issues are philosophers’ bread-and-butter..

Nevertheless, the Russian offensive across eastern Ukraine has gained more territory in two provinces that have been fought over by Moscow-aligned separatists and Kyiv since 2014. Ukraine officials say Kremlin forces have targeted residential areas in the east with dozens of strikes, but have also suffered an embarrassing defeat. And for the first time since Feb. 18, US officials said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu. —David E. Rovella

	          > Yesterday, the implosion of the TerraUSD stablecoin kindled wide-spread panic in the crypto space. But 24 hours later, things   looked a bit calmer. Terraform Labs restarted the Terra blockchain following a software update to help avoid attacks against the network. In the land of equities, however, there was little calm in the air on Thursday. More hair-raising volatility in the S&P 500 pushed the index within spitting distance of a 20% drop. Coming 30 points from a bear market before an end-of-day rally, the benchmark appears destined to decrease for a   sixth straight week, something that hasn’t happened since June 2011. While recessionary fears tied to the U.S. central bank’s inflation fight are animating many investors, Fed official Mary Daly backed raising interest rates by a half-percentage point at each of the central bank’s next two meetings, adding she’d like to see financial conditions tighten further. “Going up in 50-basis-point increments to me   makes quite a bit of sense,” she said. “And there’s no reason right now that I see in the economy to pause on doing that in the next couple of meetings.” —David E. Rovella

	          > BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2022-05-12 We: Optimal control. You have an objective: to get inflation back into its target range over the medium term—five to ten years from now—and to do so while doing the least damage to other objectives like employment and growth. If your best forecast is that your current policy path gets you there, you maintain your currency policy path. If your best forecast is that your current policy path does not get you there, you take the cheapest and most effective step to move the future needle. If the bond-market 5-year 5-year forward inflation breakeven is not the best forecast, what is the best forecast? Indeed, given that inflation is an expectational phenomenon in all our standard models—inflation will be what it is expected to be plus policy-change and economic-shock terms—it is very hard to see how the bond-market 5-year 5-year forward inflation breakeven could not be the best forecast. And if our standard models are not the best models, what are the best models? Thus I look at this, and I think those who claim inflation is “out of control” are doing their audiences and their selves no good service…

At the same time, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has signed “mutual security assurances” with Sweden and is to travel to Helsinki to sign a similar declaration with Finland. The UK is committing to support the two nations’ armed forces if they come under attack, which may smooth the way for both countries to apply for membership in NATO.

	  Given a reward  and a deterministic episodic environment where episodes end with a ``generate '' action, how do we generate diverse and high-reward s?
	  We propose to use Flow Networks to model discrete  from which we can sample sequentially (like episodic RL, rather than iteratively as MCMC methods would). We show that our method, GFlowNet, is very useful on a combinatorial domain, drug molecule synthesis, because unlike RL methods it generates diverse s by design.

	          > The European Union’s top executive flew to Budapest in a bid to break a deadlock on the bloc’s proposed oil embargo against Russia. Currently, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has remained friendly with the Kremlin despite its war on Ukraine, stands in the way. The EU seems set to soften its sanctions package on Russian oil exports, though it aims to keep a key shipping provision that will hinder Moscow’s ability to sell its crude. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin defied speculation that he might use an annual military parade to announce an escalation of his faltering offensive in Donbas. As Putin marked the 77th anniversary of the allied defeat of Nazi Germany, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy slammed his attempt to use that war to defend Russian aggression that’s killed thousands of civilians through the bombing of residential areas and alleged mass executions. France’s Emmanuel Macron drew a different historical parallel, warning against humiliating Russia with a reference to Germany’s defeat in World War I—and the aftermath. Meanwhile, a Russian government forecast shows the nation faces its deepest economic contraction in almost three decades. —Natasha Solo-Lyons

Wade. But on Wall Street, the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are mulling extending benefits to cover travel for reproductive services, potentially joining Citigroup, Amazon and Uber in similar efforts. Republican lawmakers want to make such moves expensive for employers, however. More broadly, if the Republican-appointee dominated high court follows through on the draft opinion by Samuel Alito, the legal fallout could eventually endanger same-sex marriage and contraceptive rights. Closer aboard, such a ruling may worsen what’s already one of the highest rates of maternal death in childbirth of any developed nation. And politically, in a country where a clear majority favors the right to abortion, such a decision is likely to further polarize the coming midterm elections.

The unemployment rate held at 3.6% and average hourly earnings rose, albeit at a more moderate pace from a month earlier. The data showed average hourly earnings climbing only 0.3%. As Wall Street hopes for signs that inflation will slow, the jury is out on whether April’s wage growth is the beginning of sustained moderation or just a temporary break. “The ‘glass-half-full’ view,” according to Bloomberg Economics, “would say the odds for the Fed to engineer a soft landing have just increased.” —David E.

That’s one out of every 500 people on Earth. They were mostly individuals killed by the virus, but also included those who died of other afflictions because health systems were overwhelmed by the infected. Though the U.S.—long the leader in confirmed infections and deaths—has now surpassed more than a million known fatalities, the new report says a larger number of deaths were in India. —David E.

	          > The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed as authentic a draft opinion supported by five Republican-appointed justices that would overturn the landmark abortion rights case Roe v Wade, sending shockwaves across the country. Published by Politico on Monday, the opinion—if it becomes final—would be transformational for an already-riven America—legally, politically and socially. Legal experts warned such a ruling could be a wider threat to other rights and spell the end of gay marriage and access to contraceptives. U.S. President Joe Biden pushed Congress to pass laws legalizing abortion—something Senate Republicans would almost certainly block. Millions of American women live in the two dozen states where abortion would likely be outlawed. Fallout from a ruling overturning Roe may implicate other critical issues currently affecting American women: the U.S. ranks as one of the worst in the developed world for maternal mortality; the nation has no federal paid parental leave; and regular, affordable or subsidized childcare (as the Covid-19 pandemic exposed) remains a key reason why women are being forced out of the workforce. —Margaret Sutherlin

Moscow’s forces have been attacking along most of the so-called contact line that’s divided pro-Russian separatist areas in the east from the rest of Ukraine. European Union energy ministers are meeting to discuss Vladimir Putin’s decision to cut gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria as Putin deputy Sergei Lavrov reaffirmed payments must be converted into rubles, making it hard for Europeans to secure supplies without   violating international sanctions. —Natasha Solo-Lyons

	          > Elon Musk plans to make Twitter a privately-held social media platform unfettered by restrictions on some types of speech. What that would actually mean however isn’t entirely clear. Though Musk seems to think drug jokes are fine, it could include loosening rules against hate speech and false information—not to mention reinstating certain banned accounts. One stipulation in the proposed $44 billion deal prohibits Musk from public comments that “disparage the company.” If the deal does go through, the richest person in the world is likely to face a different set of obstacles than he has at Tesla. As Liam Denning writes in Bloomberg Opinion, free speech “is considerably squishier than, say, selling half a million Model 3s.”

	          > In the growing mythology of Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s invading forces, light-footed infantry armed only with shoulder-fired missiles have repeatedly bloodied Vladimir Putin’s nose, killing ill-prepared and unmotivated Russians in defense of their homes and families. Yet this David-and-Goliath vision (not unlike that of the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan) is only part of the story. As has often been the case in wars like this one, it’s artillery that’s making the difference. And that’s why the U.S. and other nations are putting so much emphasis on providing howitzers to Ukraine forces. Such traditional firepower, supported by drones that allow for pinpoint targeting, will become even more dominant in the next phase of the war, along a 300-plus mile front in Donbas.

For weeks, the Kremlin has threatened to turn off pipelines if Europe didn’t pay for gas in rubles. The European Union argued that would defeat the purpose of sanctions aimed at punishing the country for its aggression. Gas prices surged 17%, amid concern that other countries could be next. But Poland says it’s fully prepared for a cutoff of all energy supplies and has been outlining plans to live without Russian gas even before the war.

	          > Elon Musk is buying Twitter for $44 billion, using one of the biggest leveraged buyout deals in history to take the 16-year-old social media platform private. Simultaneously, Musk is raising a lot of questions about Twitter’s future and that of his broader empire. While Twitter shares closed way up, Tesla shares fell on the news. One issue is what Musk will do with Twitter’s efforts to corral hate speech, Covid-19 misinformation and election manipulation of the kind Russia allegedly attempted in 2016 and 2020? Which leads to another question: will Musk reinstate Donald Trump’s account, suspended shortly after his followers violently sought to block the transfer of American power on Jan. 6, 2021? Though not directly related to ongoing investigations of his actions that day, on Monday Trump was found in contempt of court for failing to respond to subpoenas in a New York investigation of his real estate company. The judge ordered the billionaire pay a fine of $10,000 a day. —Natasha Solo-Lyons

	          > BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2022-04-25 Mo: A very nice piece by Mark Hertling on why we should have hopes for the Ukraine Army during its current turn in the Inferno: Mark Hertling: ’A few folks suggested I’ve been “bold” in some of my predictions..." I had a brief piece on the complexity of war-as-a-profession two months ago: Ibn Khaldun called it assibayah: understanding that it is your group, that you have a job to do in order for it to properly perform, and that your job requires the right kind of coordination. For most of history, a commander with assibayah handled logistics, inspiration, and delivered soldiers to the right battlefield; and soldiers with assibayah knew how to handle their weapons while protecting those standing next to them. And with assibayah, soldiers supplied who trusted their leader and found themselves on the right battlefield were nearly invincible. F——— phalanx. F——— legion. F——— knights. F——— longbowmen. F——— pikemen. And, above all (usually), f——— horse-archers. But then, with the coming of personal firearms, it all became more complicated. It turned into rock → paper → scissors. Cavalry rode down musketeers. Musketeers rolled over pikemen. Pikemen drove off cavalry. And artillery was a joker that could break up the pike phalanx and disorder the other arms to render them combat ineffective—unless and until it was itself overrun. Tactical victory required combined arms, and the right kind of combined arms, so that their cavalry faced your pikemen, their pikemen faced your musketeers, and their musketeers were ridden down by your cavalry. As time passed, things became more complex.And in all of this, (fewer) professionals could easily defeat (more) amateurs. And professionals could be defeated by better professionals who understood the principles of combined-arms warfare better. How is it that Arthur Wellesley could win at, consecutively, Roliça, Vimeiro, Oporto, Talavera, Buçaco, Fuentes de Onoro, Salamanca, Vitoria, the Pyrenees, Bidassoa, Nivelle, Toulouse, and Waterloo? (Note, however, that his siege efforts were often unsuccessful.) As von Clausewitz wrote: “war is very simple, but the simplest thing is very difficult”. How much does the Ukrainian Army really know what it is doing? And how much of that knowledge can be transmitted quickly to replacements? We can hope. Note: The best single thing I have read on all of this is: Daniel P. Bolger: Dragons at War: 2-34 Infantry in the Mojave <https://archive.org/details/dragonsatwar234i0000bolg/>

While revealing the Kremlin aims to subjugate the entire south and east of Ukraine, Major General Rustam Minnekayev, acting commander of Russia’s Central Military District, said the Transnistria region of Moldova could be targeted, too. Like portions of Ukraine’s Donbas region, separatists backed by Moscow’s soldiers hold sway in Transnistria. As a prelude to justifying invasion or even annexation (as with Crimea in 2014), Ukrainian officials are now warning Russia may be planning fraudulent referendums in the south similar to ones held previously in Donetsk and Luhansk.

	          > Vladimir Putin announced that Russia had seized the strategic port city of Mariupol, having spent almost two months leveling much of it and killing as many as 20,000 of its inhabitants, according to Ukraine estimates. Putin’s adjutants said more than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers remain inside a massive steel complex there, holding out in a seemingly lost cause. Mariupol would be the biggest city taken by Russia so far in its botched war on Ukraine, but Ihor Zhovkva, deputy chief of Ukraine’s presidential staff, said it’s “premature” to say the city has fallen. Around 100,000 civilians remain there, with some hiding in bunkers inside the steel mill, according to Mayor Vadym Boychenko. Around 40,000 have been taken to Russia or territory it controls, he said. The mayor has previously accused Putin’s forces of trying to conceal civilian deaths by trucking corpses to mass graves west of the city.

The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee—which includes Goldman Sachs, Barclays and JPMorgan—said Wednesday that a “potential failure-to-pay” event occurred for credit-default swaps when Russia paid rubles after foreign banks declined to process U.S. currency transfers. If Russia doesn’t pay up in dollars by the time its grace period expires on May 4, it would be the country’s first default on external debt in more than a century. Holders of the swaps could then start the process of getting paid on contracts covering about $40 billion of debt.

	          > BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2022-04-20 We: What is the incoming flow of data teaching me, as I try to keep my view of the macroeconomic outlook marked to market? In normal times, the gearing between the Federal Funds rate and the real Treasury 10-year rate is about 1/3: a 3%-point rise in the Federal Funds rate carries with it a 1%-point rise in the real Treasury 10-year rate. Since the start of this year, we have had an 0.25%-point rise in the Federal Funds rate, and aa 1%-point rise in the real Treasury 10-year rate—nine times the standard gearing. Why? Because monetary policy is not just the current level of the Fed Funds rate, but is the current level plus all the forward guidance that gives the anticipated future path of the Fed Funds rate. In the shifts in monetary policy that you should pay attention to are not what the Fed does at its meetings, but rather the unexpected component of Fed actions, and the surrounding word cloud of communications that are the forward guidance. If you thought at the start of this year that the Fed was behind the curve, and that it needed, through Fed-Funds rate increases and shifts in forward guidance, to do things with effects on long-term real interest rates that would be the equivalent of a 5%-point increase in the Fed Funds rate, then I have news for you: The Fed is 3/5 of the way there. If you thought, like me, that the costs of tightening too soon and being wrong were very high—that the 2010s were a disaster, in which an ænemic secularly-stagnant economy grossly underperformed in employment and productivity growth, substantially because the Fed had let itself get trapped at the zero lower bound in nominal interest rates—then the past four months should lead you to think that the Fed is, if anything, slightly ahead of the curve right now, and should stay its (currently planned) course of Fed-Funds interest-rate increases, rather than accelerate them. Rather than accelerate rate increases further, it should watch what changes in financial conditions over the past four months are about to do to the future of housing investment. But one joker has been dealt: The 5/5 forward rate—what those trading in the bond market expect CPI inflation to be not over the next five years but over the five years after that—is now trading at the very top of what has become the normal range. If the 5/5 rate moves higher, it will be a sign that the bond market no longer trusts the Fed to maintain inflation at or below its target over the long run. That would be a sign that the economy’s inflation anchor is not lost, but starting to drag. And that would be a powerful piece of information suggesting that the Fed should accelerate its tightening cycle a notch. Overall, however, I am still on Team The-Fed-Has-Got-This, and Team This-Is-Not-Like-the–1970s-at-All.

Vladimir Putin ordered Russian companies to delist their overseas shares—winding up a process that began in 2014 when he annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region. The move could force Russian tycoons to reconfigure the ownership structure of businesses they hold. “Most companies and their main shareholders who had a listing or depositary receipts abroad won big from the financial freedoms and economic ties with the West,” said Anton Zatolokin, head of research at Otkritie Broker. “By destroying what took 30 years to build, they take a direct and indirect hit.”

	          > Kyiv officials stated that Russia has begun its widely expected assault on eastern Ukraine. After having pulled back from the north of the country following a failed effort to take the capital and other major cities, the Kremlin has been steadily moving forces to the Donbas region. With wide-ranging tank battles expected across the area’s open landscape, this new chapter of Russia’s war comes with an advantage for the Kremlin: separatist groups have been fighting the Ukrainian military there (with Moscow’s help) since 2014. Critical to any move by Russia to establish a land corridor along the Sea of Azov will be Mariupol, the port city it’s been pounding for weeks. Its remaining defenders are encircled but haven’t surrendered, Ukrainian officials said. In recent days, Russian forces also renewed  their barrage on cities all across the country, including strikes on what it claims are arms depots in Lviv, near the border with Poland.

And that requirement for how to live a comfortable life—it, to say the least, profoundly marked humanity and its history. Now and in the future—since 2010—however, we are rich enough—technology is advanced enough, growth is fast enough, and women have other ways of gaining social power than being the mothers of sons enough that Malthusian pressures no longer keep us so poor—that we can all lead comfortable lives, in the sense that it is straightforward to produce enough, so our collective economic problems are ones of distributing the enough and of using it appropriately to make us happy rather than miserable. In between 1870 and 2010—during the long 20th century—things were both marvelous and terrible, but in the context of previous human history more marvelous than terrible...

	          > Unsatisfied with just being Twitter’s largest investor and one of its most followed users, the world’s richest man now wants to buy the company outright. Elon Musk told the board he thinks Twitter isn’t meeting its free speech “societal imperative” and should become a private company.  But as Timothy O’Brien notes in Bloomberg Opinion, Musk’s aim isn’t freedom of expression but control. Adding to the attention: A Twitter shareholder sued Musk (who already has a Plan B). For its part, Twitter adopted a poison pill to thwart any hostile takeover bids. Meanwhile, company founder Jack Dorsey has ascended to the rank of Bitcoin spiritual adviser.

If that’s indeed the plan, the Kremlin risks repeating at least some of the mistakes of the past seven weeks. If Russia throws units into the fight at the height of Ukraine’s spring mud season, when the ground is too soft and wet for trucks and mobile artillery to move off-road without getting stuck, it may leave convoys stranded and vulnerable to the kinds of attacks that killed thousands of Russians during Vladimir Putin’s failed attempt to take Kyiv.

			- Sri Lanka was downgraded deeper into junk by Fitch to CC, one step above default. Earlier, S&amp;P also cut its score to CC, the third-lowest level. The government said Tuesday it will no longer service external debts to conserve foreign currency for crucial imports, such as fuel, as the country is rattled by power cuts, food shortages and a currency in free fall. There have been mounting calls for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, to resign. So far,  China has yet to respond to Sri Lanka’s pleas for $2.5 billion in credit support.

The city is a key target as Russia prepares for a widely anticipated offensive in Ukraine’s east. Vladimir Putin’s broader desire to splinter or roll back NATO however continues to boomerang—this time from the north. Finland started a process that’s expected to lead it into NATO as a direct response to the Kremlin’s war, while Sweden’s ruling party is reportedly planning to follow suit. But in France, far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen said she wants NATO to enter an alliance with Russia once the war ends.

	          > Spurred by Russia’s war on Ukraine and continuing economic fallout from the pandemic, U.S. inflation rose in March by the most since late 1981, reinforcing pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively. The main sources of pain during the month were gasoline and food. Though some economic experts contend the current inflation reading of 8.5% is likely its peak, the path down the mountain can’t come soon enough for many consumers. That said, when excluding volatile food and energy components, so-called core prices increased just 0.3% from a month earlier, due in large part to the biggest drop in used vehicle prices since 1969 and a price deceleration in other categories. Used car prices, which had been a driver of higher goods inflation for months, were down 3.8% in March, the second straight monthly decline. The figures are “a welcome respite from the sustained heated core increases of late, and fuel costs look to ease in response to the recent pullback in oil prices,” Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note. But he warned that rent and food will be problems for longer. Here’s your  markets wrap. —Margaret Sutherlin

While sanctions have undoubtedly hurt Russia’s economy, energy exports are still helping prop up its finances. European energy companies have also found a loophole to appease public opinion, Javier Blas writes in Bloomberg Opinion. The ruble, mocked by U.S. President Joe Biden as “rubble,” has surged back to where it was before the war—though there’s a big caveat. Still, sanctions may continue to fall short as long they don’t interrupt Russia’s fossil fuel industry.

At least 50 of them were killed in the assault on Kramatorsk train station, reportedly with the use of cluster munitions. Such weapons are banned under international treaty given their capacity to maximize carnage.

Some eyewitnesses claimed Chechens were among them as well, Der Spiegel magazine reported. German officials, who presented the intelligence to lawmakers in Berlin Wednesday, say the intercepts indicate that the murder of civilians in the town of Bucha was not an act by rogue forces, but may have been part of a deliberate strategy to foment terror.

	  There are several authentication standards available today such as API Keys, 
	  OAuth [https://oauth.net/2/], JWT [

Kremlin forces are pulling back from at least one area, however. Russian soldiers are leaving the site of the doomed Chernobyl nuclear plant after Ukrainian authorities said some of them received significant doses of radiation.

On Wednesday, Russia  attacked the area around Kyiv and said there was no “breakthrough” in peace talks. In between these apparently contradictory moves, the U.S. and its NATO allies had expressed deep skepticism about Russian motivations for (let alone promises of) “de-escalation.” The wariness seemed to be borne out as civilians in villages and towns in northern Ukraine reportedly came under fire by Kremlin forces just as they were expecting a respite from the violence. As Russia continues to say it is moving troops east to Donbas, U.S. intelligence contends news of both the botched invasion and losses to Ukrainian defenders may not be  making it all the way to Vladimir Putin’s ears.

Those developments, however, came as Ukrainian officials warn Vladimir Putin is simply looking to cut his losses after a month-long invasion that failed to take a major city and reportedly cost him thousands of dead soldiers. After largely destroying some of those cities while killing hundreds if not thousands of civilians, the announced “de-escalation” is being seen in some quarters as merely a tactic as Putin consolidates gains in the east and tries to establish a land corridor with Ukraine’s occupied Crimean peninsula.

	          > Russia’s continuing siege of the pulverized coastal city of Mariupol has killed almost 5,000 people, including 200 children, according to its mayor. While civilian casualties in Russia’s month-long war on Ukraine are widely believed to exceed the more than 1,100 confirmed by the United Nations, the actual number of lives lost has been difficult to verify. Despite reports that the Kremlin is moving to consolidate gains in the east, cities across Ukraine are still being pounded by Russian artillery.

	          > Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has forced countries to quickly recalibrate their reliance on Russian energy. The European Union will receive an infusion of natural gas from the U.S. to speed its move away from Russian supplies. India, however, has stepped up purchases of Russian crude. The relationship between Beijing and Moscow has become more complicated, but experts doubt there will be a rupture in the flow of oil and coal. Energy is just one example of how Russia’s war on Ukraine “could mark a lasting change in the way the world economy works,” John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge write in Bloomberg Opinion, unless the West is wise enough to remake the global order.

	          > The U.S. and the European Union will push to boost supplies of liquefied natural gas to European countries by the end of 2022 in a bid to displace some Russian gas. Under the agreement, Europe will get at least 15 billion cubic meters of additional LNG supplies by the end of the year, though it’s not clear where it will come from. Member states will also work to ensure demand and facilities to take in as much as 50 billion cubic meters of American fuel until at least 2030. The aim of course is to help the continent wean itself off Russian gas, which accounts for about 40% of Europe’s needs, while further putting the screws to the Kremlin over its war on Ukraine. “We’re coming together to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy,” U.S. President Joe Biden said at a joint press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who added that 15 billion cubic meters this year “is a big step in that direction.” Still, when compared to how much energy Russia currently sells Europe, they have a very long way to go

	          > If Vladimir Putin hoped his war on Ukraine would shake up the global order, he was right—but likely not in the way he envisioned. NATO said Wednesday it would add more battlegroups including thousands more troops on its eastern flank and pledged to help Ukraine if Putin (as U.S. intelligence has warned he might) uses weapons of mass destruction. “Any use of chemical weapons would totally change the nature of the conflict,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stolenberg warned. The U.S. has repeatedly said that Moscow may be planning to stage a “false flag” event as pretext to use such weapons, a strategy the Kremlin was accused of trying out before launching its war one month ago. On the  economic front, Putin is trying to leverage the energy market to his advantage, demanding so-called unfriendly nations pay for gas in Russian rubles. The move has the potential to aggravate Europe’s worst energy crunch since the 1970s. The European Union has said it would continue to tighten sanctions against Russia, but given its reliance on Russia for fossil fuel, wouldn’t include energy. That said, the EU and the U.S. are close to a deal aimed at slashing Europe’s dependence on Russian energy. —Margaret Sutherlin

The moves are expected to cap a day of diplomacy that will see Biden attend an emergency NATO summit, a meeting of the Group of 7 and a session of the European Council. In addition to sanctions, the U.S. and partner nations are to unveil a new action aimed at “enhancing European energy security and reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian gas,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said. A key issue among some allied nations is how far to go in restricting Russian fossil fuel, given their reliance on it.

While most have remained in the country, about 3.4 million have fled to other nations, such as Poland. In Mariupol, the Ukrainian port city Russia has largely destroyed, thousands of civilians have been killed in their homes and shelters, according to local officials, though the numbers could not be confirmed. Over the weekend, Russia demanded that the encircled city   surrender. The Ukrainians refused.

The Federal Reserve is to undertake the most aggressive hikes since the mid-2000s. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he thinks the U.S. economy “can handle” the tighter monetary policy and avoid a recession. But there could be a rub. “Once inflation gets going, it’s hard to stop,” Allison Schrager writes in Bloomberg Opinion. “The Fed appears to be hoping that inflation will go away on its own if it stops accommodating and the supply chain and oil market work out their kinks.”

In its fourth week and largely stalled, Vladimir Putin’s attack on his neighbor is pivoting into modern siege warfare, with forces surrounding cities and shelling civilian populations, western officials said. “Russia is now pursuing a strategy of attrition,” said Lieutenant General Jim Hockenhull, the U.K.’s Chief of Defence Intelligence. “This will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. This will result in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure and intensify the humanitarian crisis.”

Biden accused Vladimir Putin’s forces of committing “atrocities” including attacking civilian areas. Hours earlier, Russian forces bombed a theater in Mariupol sheltering hundreds of civilians, according to the city council there. The Kremlin denies targeting civilians. “Putin is afflicting appalling, appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine,” Biden said Wednesday at the White House, adding “it’s god awful.” Biden later called Putin a “war criminal.”

In Mariupol, a key city that’s been a focus of the Kremlin’s assault, Associated Press journalists on the ground who documented a Russian attack on a maternity hospital reported that a pregnant woman and her baby injured in the bombing had died. Images of the woman being rushed to an ambulance on a stretcher have circled the world. Russian officials falsely called the photos fake.

With gasoline above $4 a gallon, U.S. drivers might consider electric vehicles. But the surging price of nickel, a key battery metal produced by Russia, is making EV production  a lot more expensive. (Who’s the big shot behind nickel’s “bad short” anyway?) Some economists now fear a return of 70’s era stagflation. “The numbers are almost certain to get worse before they get better,” Jonathan Levin writes in Bloomberg Opinion.

But the Black Sea port of Mariupol continues to be a major catastrophe, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. “There is a real humanitarian disaster there.”

Vladimir Putin’s failure to take a major city in two weeks of fighting may have forced him to send in most of the troops he had massed on Ukraine’s borders. He also seems to be doubling down on the leveling of the democratic nation in an ever-more brutal war with a rising number of killings of civilians. “They wanted Crimea 2014,” Caucasus scholar Thomas de Waal said of Russia. “But they got Chechnya 1994.” On Wednesday, Ukraine authorities said, Kremlin forces bombed a maternity hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol.

The U.S. move will be matched in part by the U.K., which announced a ban on Russian oil imports, though it will continue to allow natural gas and coal from the country. “The U.S. is targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy,” Biden said Tuesday in Washington. “We will not be part of subsidizing Putin’s war.” The escalation in sanctions comes as the United Nations reported that close to 500 civilians have been confirmed killed by Russian attacks across Ukraine, including dozens of children, though it added the actual number is likely much higher. Millions of Ukrainians have fled the massive assault by Kremlin forces, which are now intensifying their bombing of Kyiv. —David E. Rovella

	          > As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine heads toward the two-week mark, the stakes look set to rise — with potentially catastrophic implications for Ukrainians and their defense. Despite Russia’s status as the most-sanctioned nation in the world, President Vladimir Putin said the war will continue until Ukraine accepts his demands and halts resistance, dimming hopes for a negotiated settlement. Fresh talks Monday between Ukrainian and Russian officials made only limited progress on negotiating a cease-fire, the government in Kyiv said. There was no immediate statement from Russian negotiators. Still, the Ukrainian delegation said talks would continue. It comes amid continued Russian aggression and growing concerns about a spiraling humanitarian disaster. Russian forces destroyed an atomic-physics lab under international safeguards in Ukraine’s second-largest city, the head of the world’s nuclear watchdog said, underscoring growing safety concerns over fighting around the country’s facilities. Meanwhile, in Kyiv’s middle-class suburbs, desperate civilians are trapped, and three attempts so far to create a system for the safe passage of civilians have fallen apart within hours amid mutual recrimination. Follow the latest developments on the war. —Natasha Solo-Lyons

Despite a United Nations vote to end the fighting immediately, Russian forces continued to bombard Kyiv and other cities, including the key port of Odesa. Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated to France’s Emmanuel Macron that he will not stop the attack until the current Ukrainian government is ousted. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed again to Putin to stop the war and negotiate, while the U.S. issued more sanctions against Russia’s elites, isolating the country further from the global economic stage. In a week where nothing has felt certain, one thing has become clear: A major humanitarian tragedy is unfolding in Europe.  Nearly a million people have fled Ukraine, with millions more to follow. Follow the  latest developments on the war. —Margaret Sutherlin

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of committing acts of “terror” as it pounds his country despite international fury and unprecedented sanctions. And now Ukraine reports 300 tanks are massed on its border with Belarus, indicating that the Russian ally may soon join the conflict. Belarus has denied it intends to invade.

	          > Russia gave civilians one road out of Kyiv as its forces pushed their advance around the Ukrainian capital and other key urban centers, overshadowing tentative diplomatic efforts at achieving a cease-fire following President Vladimir Putin’s invasion. A Ukrainian delegation led by the defense minister agreed to further talks after meeting with Russian officials on the border with Belarus. But at the same time, the Ukrainian government was reporting a   rising number of civilian deaths at the hands of Russia’s military as residential areas increasingly come under fire. At home, Putin is paying a high economic price for his war. A wall of western sanctions targeting Russian banks, companies and individuals led to a collapse in the ruble and prompted the central bank to impose capital controls to allay investor panic. The bank more than doubled its key interest rate to 20%. As Russia’s economy is caught in the closing vise of unprecedented global sanctions, Putin’s televised order that his nuclear forces assume a   heightened alert status has been getting ever more scrutiny. Here’s the latest on the war. —David E. Rovella

U.S. President Joe Biden also announced new export curbs. But western allies spared Vladimir Putin’s oil exports and didn’t block Russian access to SWIFT, the global bank messaging system. European countries remain concerned about their supply of natural gas, much of which comes from Russia. “The West is financing Putin’s war” by buying Russian natural resources, Javier Blas writes in Bloomberg Opinion. As the West seeks to further isolate the Kremlin and Putin, China said bilateral trade would continue as normal.

	          > Vladimir Putin’s invasion forces attacked Kyiv on Friday, but their advance across Ukraine reportedly faced stiffer resistance as western officials contend Moscow wasn’t meeting its military goals. The multi-pronged Russian invasion begun on Thursday has been marked by indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and strikes on protected facilities such as hospitals, Amnesty International said, adding that it documented three incidents in which at least six civilians were killed and a dozen wounded. Ukrainian authorities said about 140 people have been killed and told residents to “prepare Molotov cocktails” to defend against Russian soldiers. Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba alleged Russians shelled a kindergarten and an orphanage while Russian officials contend they have only targeted military installations in their bid to bring down the nation’s democratic government. A back-and-forth between both sides about proposed talks took place during the day. Outside Ukraine, Western allies led by the U.S. for the first time ever activated the NATO Response Force to strengthen defenses of member states bordering Russia. European Union leaders meanwhile backed more sanctions which they said will limit Russia’s access to Europe’s financial sector and restrict key technologies. Together, the EU and U.S. also approved the symbolic gesture of personally sanctioning Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. United Nations agencies forecast as many as 4 million refugees will flee Ukraine to neighboring countries if the Russian invasion continues. Here’s the latest on the war. —Natasha Solo-Lyons

Kremlin forces moved swiftly to take control of major cities, effectively eliminating Ukraine’s air defenses with missile volleys landing   all across the country. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the Russian war a “barbaric attack” while European nations backed an unprecedented sanctions package, though omitting key components some see as most effective in punishing Moscow. Later, U.S. President Joe Biden imposed more sanctions on Russia, its banks and industries. But he too held back on measures where the collateral damage to European economies could be high.

In a televised address, Biden announced sanctions over the decision by Vladimir Putin to send more troops into two so-called separatist republics inside Ukraine, and said the move sets the stage for a larger-scale invasion. Kremlin forces already occupy Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. In coordination with European allies and others, the U.S. said it’s implementing a first round of sanctions, effectively cutting Moscow off from Western financing. Biden added he would announce other targeted sanctions against Russian oligarchs and their families in the coming days. Germany halted the  Nord Stream 2 pipeline, one of Putin’s biggest priorities, and the U.K. announced additional sanctions targeting banks.

	          > America’s consumption boom is still running at full-throttle with retail sales surging in January by the most in 10 months. The spike highlights a steady appetite for merchandise such as cars and furniture, and might suggest consumers are buying big-ticket items before interest rates rise. It’s a boon for Walmart, which   bucked pandemic-induced supply chain issues, labor shortfalls and rising prices to post higher-than-expected quarterly profit. “Walmart has a cart full of reasons to love inflation,” writes Andrea Felsted in Bloomberg Opinion. But one study says Americans aren’t getting value for their money. And in China, U.S. and foreign brands including Nike and Adidas are on a downward trajectory, as politics increasingly inform spending habits in that huge market.

	          > President Joe Biden said U.S. intelligence has prompted him to believe that Vladimir Putin has decided to attack Ukraine, and that a new invasion including a strike on Kyiv could come within days. “We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people,” Biden said Friday from the White House. The U.S. said Russia has massed as many as 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine, including Russian-backed separatists, in what it called the most significant military mobilization since World War II. Leaders of separatist forces in Ukraine’s east have said they are sending children, women and elderly to Russia, a move NATO allies said may presage a false-flag event to cover a Russian invasion (Moscow has denied planning either action, or a massive cyberattack this week the U.S. contends the Kremlin was behind). The Ukrainian military said the rebels have accelerated shelling along the so-called contact line while the rebels accused the military of attacking them, which Kyiv has denied. In addition to conventional, live-fire exercises with Belarus along Ukraine’s northern border, Vladimir Putin has ordered drills of Russia’s strategic nuclear forces this weekend, including ballistic and cruise-missile launches. Here’s the latest on the crisis. —David E. Rovella
