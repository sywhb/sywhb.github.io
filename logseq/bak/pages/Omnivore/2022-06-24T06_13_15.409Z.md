	          > Having already painted a picture of Donald Trump allegedly directing¬†or at the very least being keenly aware of¬†a wide-ranging plan to¬†subvert the 2020 US presidential election, the Jan. 6 committee on Thursday moved to depict how the former president and his aides sought to use the formidable authority of the Department of Justice to¬†keep him in power. Key to this unprecedented endeavor, the committee argued, was a letter written by a midlevel environmental lawyer‚Äîto be signed by top Justice Department officials‚Äîfalsely claiming election fraud in swing states. The unsent letter, electronic message evidence and¬†testimony by senior members of the Trump Justice Department combined today to describe what¬†panel members said was a¬†desperate effort to¬†erase the election of¬†Joe Biden and keep Trump at the head of the American government. The strategy, according to Select Committee Chair and Mississippi Democrat¬†Bennie Thompson, was to help Trump ‚Äústeal an election he already lost.‚Äù

	          > In a keynote at PyCon 2022 in Salt
	  Lake City, Utah, Peter Wang introduced another entrant in the field of
	  in-browser Python interpreters.  The Python community has long sought a way
	  to be able to write Python‚Äîinstead of JavaScript‚Äîto run in web browsers, and there
	  have been various efforts to do so over the years.  Wang announced PyScript as a new framework, built atop
	  one of those earlier projects, to allow
	  Python scripting directly within the browser; those programs have access to
	  much of the existing Python ecosystem as well as being able to interact
	  with the browser document object model (DOM) directly. 
	  In addition, he gave some rather eye-opening demonstrations as part of the talk.

	          > Moderna, which along with Pfizer-BioNTech led the way in producing mRNA vaccines against the novel coronavirus, announced some progress in the next generation of shots that could address the wildfire-like contagiousness of the omicron strain¬†of Covid-19. The company said its¬†omicron-targeting vaccine triggered the production of antibodies against its newest variants, though the immune response was less robust than seen with the original version of omicron. In the US, the Biden administration has been pleading with Congress to free up funding so the latest vaccines will be available when cold weather returns and booster efficacy fades. With America‚Äôs political divide hampering both new vaccine funding and the inoculation of young children, its latest wave as measured by hospitalization continues to¬†rise. Globally, omicron is still¬†driving surges in China¬†and¬†Singapore, which saw a 23% week-on-week increase.¬†‚ÄîDavid E. Rovella

	          > BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2022-06-22 We: If I were Marc Andreesen, I would say this: "You, Tyler Cowen, are an example of a person doing a podcast. You are comfortable enough, with several sources of income, and do not care much about monetizing your podcast in a serious way. But in that you are anonymous. Most of the people who in a good future would be making podcasts and so adding value, knowledge, and entertainment to the world will not do so unless they can monetize it in some way. At the moment we are split into two intermets. The first is a "Web1" Internet, in which the expectation is for free and so people are strongly resistant to making micro payments and so nobody makes any money. The second is a ‚ÄúWeb2‚Äù internet, in which big companies have figured out how to do some monetization, and have capitalized on this to create walled gardens‚Äîthus greatly disrupting the scope and reach of the network‚Äîin which they grab the lion‚Äôs share of the money for themselves, thus restricting the number of those who can afford to create: the Facebooks, Googles, Apples, and so forth.¬†Podcasting is, if things continue as they have, headed for a future in which some get sucked into the walled gardens, in which those podcasters who hit the celebrity-reinforcement loop get rich, in which ‚ÄúWeb2‚Äù companies profit enormously, and in which a very large chunk of those who in a good world would be members of the long tail making a reasonable living have to drop out, and only those truly driven to communicate or with alternate comfortable means have the freedom to be able to afford to podcast.¬†We ‚ÄúWeb3‚Äù people want a different future for podcasting. And at the heart of that will be a web of identity and network connections and trusted payments that is not the property of any single walled-garden entity that is a wannabee monopolist, but is the common creation of the community as a whole."¬†That is what I would say if I were Marc Andreessen in the video below.What does this vision of ‚ÄúWeb3‚Äù that I think Marc Andreessen should have laid out in his conversation with Tyler Cowen tell us about the proper value of BitCoin today?¬†It says: the proper value of BitCoin today is zero. Ownership of BitCoin today gives you no property rights over the useful BlockChain databases that will underpin the community-owned web of identity and network connections and trusted payments that is the heart of the good Web3 future. Indeed, to imagine that you will be able to grab huge amounts of money from the l BlockChain databases that will underpin the community-owned web of identity and network connections and trusted payments in the good Web3 future is to make a category mistake: it is Web2 thinking. Nothing will give you property rights over the useful BlockChain databases that will underpin the community-owned web of identity and network connections and trusted payments that is the heart of the good Web3 future. If something would, than it would not be the good Web3 future.¬†Yes, this poses ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù for Andreessen-Horwitz‚Äôs crypto-Web3 business model. Perhaps that is why he did not say it‚Ä¶

	          > The bipartisan Congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection turned its attention on Thursday to former Vice President Mike Pence, whose central role in preventing what the committee called an attempted coup by Donald Trump echoed across much of the day‚Äôs testimony. The hearing depicted an increasingly ominous campaign by Trump to pressure Pence to illegally block the transfer of power to Joe Biden. Evidence presented by committee members¬†illustrated with stark detail the alleged violent intent of some Trump followers‚Äîstirred up by Trump‚Äôs speech and social media postings‚Äîand how on Jan. 6 some came within 40 feet of Pence as he fled. But just as darkly, testimony by¬†Greg Jacob, who was Pence‚Äôs chief counsel, and J. Michael Luttig, a conservative legal icon¬†and former federal appellate judge, focused on another man‚ÄîTrump lawyer John¬†Eastman. Eastman was one of the alleged architects of what the committee called Trump‚Äôs plan to stay in power, proposing ways in which Pence could violate the Constitution to Trump‚Äôs benefit, witnesses said. (Eastman repeatedly invoked his right against self-incrimination at his deposition.) As the hearing ended, Luttig‚Äîwho called Trump a ‚Äúclear and present danger‚Äù to American democracy‚Äîwas asked to reflect on what lay ahead.

In addition to tapping the nation‚Äôs Strategic Petroleum Reserve to address high gas prices and working with European partners on plans to get Ukrainian grain to market, Biden cited proposals aimed at bringing down the cost of child care and prescription drugs and said the wealthiest Americans must ‚Äúpay their fair share‚Äù in taxes.¬†‚ÄúI have a plan to bring down the cost of gas and food,‚Äù he said, seeking to position the Democratic Party for the coming midterm elections, but adding¬†‚Äúit‚Äôs going to take time.‚Äù¬†In Europe,‚Äã‚Äã a new survey by economists shows many expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates  faster and further than anticipated just a month ago as it battles the highest inflation in decades.

But somehow social democracy failed its sustainability test, and was replaced by neoliberalism, which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it would make the rich much richer and give them much more social power...

	          > With a deafening roar, the US stock market ran headlong into bear territory, the S&P sinking 20% below a January peak and hitting its lowest mark since the previous January. Tech shares bore the brunt¬†of the Monday rout, with the Nasdaq 100 slumping about 4.5%. Speculative areas of the market inflated by years of government largesse buckled as profitless software firms, newly public companies and blank-check entities were unceremoniously¬†dumped. Credit markets continued their historic repricing of rate trajectories: Treasury 10-year yields climbed to the highest since 2011¬†while two-year rates jumped to levels last seen before the 2008 financial crisis. The cost to protect investment-grade debt from default soared as a closely watched segment of the US bond curve inverted. And Bitcoin took another dive,¬†tumbling to its¬†lowest¬†point in about 18 months¬†after withdrawals tied to the Celsius lending platform were frozen.¬†Only the dollar provided some respite.

	          > The first public hearing of the Congressional committee¬†investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol left no doubt as to its position on who was responsible. House members labeled the deadly attempt to block the transfer of power an ‚Äúattempted coup‚Äù¬†and said it was the bloody culmination of a seven-part plan that began before the 2020 election‚Äîa plan ultimately moved¬†forward by¬†one person. The bipartisan committee alleged¬†criminal acts by Donald Trump and his aides, punctuating arguments with gruesome video of his followers doing violence to Capitol police, along with similarly powerful witness testimony. With more public hearings scheduled through the month, the world is likely to get more insight into the events of that day and other facets of a purportedly wide-ranging bid to subvert American¬†democracy. But Congress cannot prosecute federal crimes‚Äîthat‚Äôs the job of the Department of Justice. Its unprecedented nationwide probe continues to slowly accumulate arrests, guilty pleas, cooperators and convictions. As Congress completes its report, all eyes will turn to Attorney General Merrick Garland, and the course of his inquiry into an alleged seditious conspiracy.¬†‚ÄîDavid E. Rovella

But the chances that death tolls from Buffalo, New York, to Uvalde, Texas, and Tulsa, Oklahoma will spur federal action¬†remain slim. At the state level, New York passed a gun control package that would raise the legal age to buy semiautomatic rifles to 21.

The US had been seeking to pivot toward Asia (China in particular) over the past decade. But now the Biden administration‚Äôs high-level, long-term assessment is being formally reworked¬†with Kremlin aggression in mind, and an approach that links Europe and Asia. As for the war in Ukraine, some of Putin‚Äôs backers think his attempt to seize victory in the Donbas from the jaws of a larger defeat‚Äîby triggering a global food crisis and more inflation‚Äîmay actually work. ‚ÄîDavid E.

	          > From 2015: My suspicion is that Parsa was close enough to southern Mesopotamia and also close enough to Iranian pastures. They were thus able to figure out how to tax that densely-populated irrigated-farming population of southern Mesopotamia. And at the same time they were able to figure out how to use the horse-mounted herders of the Iranian pasture. Add in the growing size of then-modern larger horse. And they had an advantage in communications, in mobility, in the use of the bow, and in the use of the rider for combat. They thus brought the age of iron and horse to the fertile crescent, and did so in a way that had not been possible in the age of bronze and chariot, or even iron and chariot. But I do not know, I do not claim to know, and I have not found anybody who does know. Nor do we know why the empire held together, save that it repeatedly almost did not.¬†And, of course, the rule of the Loyal-Spirit Great Kings of Iran is followed by something even more extraordinary. At the end of the Haxamanishya Empire there is what is probably best-called its LBO, by Alexander the Great of Macedon, and then by his marshals who became his successors.

	          > BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2022-06-01 We:¬†I have long been fascinated by the Achaemenid Persian Empire of -550 to -320.¬†And I have just finished a very good book: Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones: Persians: The Age of the Great Kings <https://www.amazon.com/dp/1472277287/>, about the Achaemenid Persian Empire. The book is chock-full of wonderfully fascinating facts, connections, and interpretations of what was going on in the Near East in the Achaemenid Persian age.¬†I recommend it highly.¬†Yet it has been a long time since I read a book in which the text so undermined the proclaimed moral point-of-view of the book.¬†The proclaimed point-of-view is, basically, that Greeks have lied about the Persians‚Äîcreated a discourse of ‚ÄúOrientalism‚Äù designed to ‚Äúrepresent‚Ä¶ the ‚Äòcolonies‚Äô and cultures of the Middle Eastern world in a way that would justify and support the West‚Äôs colonial enterprise‚Ä¶‚Äù. Greeks painted Persian as ‚Äúa fantastical land of mystery, dark shadows, places of intrigue, despotic rulers, enslaved women, and wealth beyond imagination‚Ä¶‚Äù, a place of ‚Äúdecadence, luxury, and a certain backwardness of thought‚Ä¶‚Äù But this was ‚Äúa European invention‚Ä¶ of romance, exotic beings, haunting memories and landscapes, remarkable experiences‚Ä¶‚Äù.¬†It is time, he says, to move away from an invented ‚ÄúOriental‚Äù landscape in which:¬†The Great Kings are‚Ä¶ lustful, capricious, mad tyrants, and the empire is regarded as an oppressive challenge to the Greek ideals of ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô (whatever that meant)‚Ä¶ the Persians‚Ä¶ [are] cowardly, scheming, effeminate, vindictive, and dishonourable‚Ä¶. the epitome of barbarianismIt is time, he says, to present the ‚ÄúPersian Version‚Äù of history.¬†But the problem is that the book then tells‚Äîcredits‚Äîstories in which:¬†the Persian Achaemenid Emperors are lustful and capricious (if not quite mad);¬†the Persian Empire is an oppressive challenge to all who think that absolutist monarchy without any semblance of due process is a thing on the menu they would rather not order; and¬†the Persians‚Äîat least the Persian √©lite‚Äîare scheming, vindictive, and dishonorable (if no more cowardly or effeminate than the standard).¬†So I left the book thinking, rather, that more was at stake in the three battles of Marathon, Salamis, and Plataea than I had previously thought.¬†I left the book thinking more strongly that each day was a good day in which the tide of absolute monarchy and casually murderous politics was pushed back by ideas of rule-of-law, due process, and obedience-to-the-laws-we-prescribe-to-ourselves.¬†And I left the book thinking that when Llewellyn-Jones claims that:Nothing is reported of Xerxes, Artaxerxes III, Bagoas, or Parysatis which does not find ready parallels in well-attested information about Henry VIII, Ivan IV (the Terrible), or Wu Zetian‚Ä¶he is saying something that is (a) false, and (b) not to the point. To the extent that we want to proclaim ourselves adopted children of the Athenians, it is not because we see them as precursors of Henry VIII ‚ÄúThe Six-Wived‚Äù Tudor or of Ivan IV ‚ÄúThe Dreaded‚Äù Rurik.Now do not get me wrong. I do like and respect the achievements of the Achaemenid Empire. The Pax Persica was a wonderful thing for the Near East <https://delong.typepad.com/delong_long_form/2015/08/musings-on-thomas-malthus-the-hellenistic-age-the-loyal-spirit-great-kings-of-iran-550-330-bce-and-other-topics-the-hones.html>. The artisans and artists are stunning. Their view of a cosmopolitan world was far ahead of its time‚Äîeven if it was only of a world ruled by one tribe, the Persians, and one dynasty, the Haxamanishya, and one guy in the dynasty, the emperor.Nevertheless, the story of the Achaemenid Empire as it comes down to us greatly reinforces the following lessons:There are great benefits to a government of limited powers that must follow procedures.There are great benefits to a society in which people have rights, and are not just all slaves of the Great King to be tortured and murdered at his pleasure, or just because he is having a bad day.‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù is not just something to put in scare quotes and dismiss with a ‚Äúwhatever that meant‚Äù.The imperial Persian court was a shitshow.It was a shitshow from the moment that Darius I overthrew the legitimate Emperor Bardiya, and then claimed that he‚ÄîDarius‚Äî(a) never lied, (b) was the Servant of Holy Truth, and that (c) the real Bardiya had actually been killed earlier by a shape-shifting magician.Perhaps it was a shitshow even before then‚Ä¶

	          > A diminished¬†National Rifle Association went ahead with its gun industry convention this weekend as more¬†grim details emerged about the mass shooting that claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers¬†in Uvalde, Texas. Texas police agencies sought to defend against public fury over their delay in confronting the gunman‚Äîand the young lives it may have cost‚Äîwith a series of sometimes contradictory explanations. These included that local police¬†believed the assailant was barricaded alone‚Äîdespite 911 calls from children begging for help from the classroom. Across the state in Houston, the NRA convention went on amid protests, though¬†the company that made the rifle used in the massacre bowed out, as did other speakers and entertainers. Even Governor Greg Abbott, a staunch gun advocate, was to appear only on video. Among the few¬†well-known figures speaking in person to the gun lobby¬†was Donald Trump. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden and his wife are to travel to Uvalde on Sunday to meet with the families of those murdered this week.

	  Best practices for building secure API Keys
	  We all know how valuable APIs are. They‚Äôre the gateway to exploring other
	  services, integrating with them, and building great solutions faster.
	  
	  You might have built or are thinking of building APIs for other developers to
	  use. An API needs some form of authentication to provide authorised access to
	  the data it returns.
	  
	  There are several authentication standards available today such as API Keys, 
	  OAuth [https://oauth.net/2/], JWT [

	          > Vladimir Putin just made an offer to the world, one that may illustrate how badly international sanctions are biting Russia. The Kremlin leader said he‚Äôs willing to smooth the way for grain and fertilizer exports as global shortages mount‚Äîbut only if sanctions on his isolated nation are lifted. Putin didn‚Äôt specify if he was referring to Russian exports or  those from Ukraine that have been stopped (or reportedly stolen) by his military as it wages war on that¬†country. The White House swiftly rejected Putin‚Äôs quid pro quo. In Russia, the central bank delivered its third interest-rate reduction in just over a month and said borrowing costs can  fall further still, halting a rally in the ruble as it unwinds the financial defenses in place since the invasion began.¬†The pace of ruble losses quickened after the announcement, heading for a two-day slump that‚Äôs approaching 12% against the dollar. On the ground in Ukraine, Kyiv‚Äôs troops in the eastern Luhansk region are coming under constant shelling from Russians who now occupy about 95% of the territory, Ukrainian officials said.¬†There are more than 40,000 civilians in the parts of Luhansk still under Ukrainian control, including 15,000 in the town of Sievierodonetsk. The fighting, said¬†Ukraine Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar, has reached ‚Äúmaximum intensity.‚Äù¬†‚ÄîDavid E. Rovella

The growth of communities of engineering, entrepreneurial, and organizational practice is a huge benefit for innovation and growth‚Äîand the overwhelming bulk of that becomes non-rival public knowledge, that nobody can make scarce and hence charge people through the nose for. 3.¬†Having your rich and your superrich fund R&D for little return is not the worst thing to have happen. 4.¬†The ideas behind ‚ÄúWeb3‚Äù‚Äîan end to the walled-garden Web2 internet, with the useful parts of the social graph trustable and publicly accessible to anyone who wants to communicate‚Äîare great ones. 5.¬†The ideas behind ‚ÄúWeb2‚Äù‚Äîthe clickbait-ad walled-gardens‚Äîare horrible. And it is not just Facebook and Twitter. Google and Amazon are manifestly less useful to me than they were a decade and a half ago. Why? Because using pixels to inform me is less profitable than using them for selling ads, and the companies have decided to be evil. 6.¬†Code is fundamental: a tech-finance drought is no reason not to learn to code. It is a reason to get a job working for a company that already has a real product, and, you know, profits. 7.¬†At bottom, all of ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù is very familiar. It is taking out a map, drawing property lots boundaries on them, and then trying to sell those lots to people by telling them that the railroad is coming through. And in the end everyone will be very happy If the railroad does come through, and does not decide to build its river-crossing bridge ten miles north. 8.Hexapodia!

And his office is just down the hall.¬†And, you know, indeed: <madeline_kahn_voice>it‚Äôs twue, it‚Äôs twue</madeline_kahn_voice>.¬†I read one of Barry‚Äôs books. I look at black squiggles on a white page. And from them, I then spin-up something. What is it? As best as I can describe it, it is a sub-Turing instantiation of Barry‚Äôs mind. I then run that sub-Turing instantiation on a partition in my wetware. And I argue with it‚Äîhim‚Äîwhatever.¬†I am not strange. (OK. I am not that strange.)

The company‚Äôs shares have also been caught up in the growth-stock selloff as investors shun risky assets amid soaring inflation.

Asking for Matt Yglesias‚Ä¶¬†‚ÄúThe Fed‚Ä¶ should have started moving to tighter money sooner.‚Äù To get from a description of what happened in the world to an evaluation of an actor‚Äôs actions‚Äîto get to that should‚Äîyou need three things:¬†A metric mapping outcome-states-of-the-world onto their desirability (either their desirability in the eyes of the actor or in the eyes of some impartial spectator, depending on the scope of that "should).¬†A counterfactual as to what would have been the outcome-state-of-the-world had the actor in fact done what you say they should have done.¬†A switch telling us whether this is a look-back or a look-forward should: Is it an ex-ante should‚Äîthe actor had or did not have but could have gathered the information to let them conclude that the counterfactual world would have been a better outcome-state than what actually happened? Or is it merely a look-back ex-post should: given what was later revealed (but that the actor at the time did not know and could not have learned then) it would have been better to take the counterfactual action?¬†I don‚Äôt see any of those anywhere in Matt‚Äôs argument. It is true that he is not an economist, and was not an economics major, and was not even a social studies major. But these counterfactual, evaluation-framework, and potential-knowledge issues are philosophers‚Äô bread-and-butter..

	          > Yesterday, the implosion of the TerraUSD stablecoin kindled wide-spread panic in the crypto space. But 24 hours later, things   looked a bit calmer. Terraform Labs restarted the Terra blockchain following a software update to help avoid attacks against the network. In the land of equities, however, there was little calm in the air on Thursday. More hair-raising volatility in the S&P 500 pushed the index within spitting distance of a 20% drop. Coming 30 points from a bear market before an end-of-day rally, the benchmark appears destined to decrease for a   sixth straight week, something that hasn‚Äôt happened since June 2011. While recessionary fears tied to the U.S. central bank‚Äôs inflation fight are¬†animating many investors, Fed official Mary Daly backed raising interest rates by a half-percentage point at each of the central bank‚Äôs next two meetings, adding she‚Äôd like to see financial conditions tighten further. ‚ÄúGoing up in 50-basis-point increments to me   makes quite a bit of sense,‚Äù she said.¬†‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs no reason right now that I see in the economy to pause on doing that in the next couple of meetings.‚Äù¬†‚ÄîDavid E.

	          > BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2022-05-12 We: Optimal control. You have an objective: to get inflation back into its target range over the medium term‚Äîfive to ten years from now‚Äîand to do so while doing the least damage to other objectives like employment and growth. If your best forecast is that your current policy path gets you there, you maintain your currency policy path. If your best forecast is that your current policy path does not get you there, you take the cheapest and most effective step to move the future needle. If the bond-market 5-year 5-year forward inflation breakeven is not the best forecast, what is the best forecast? Indeed, given that inflation is an expectational phenomenon in all our standard models‚Äîinflation will be what it is expected to be plus policy-change and economic-shock terms‚Äîit is very hard to see how the bond-market 5-year 5-year forward inflation breakeven could not be the best forecast. And if our standard models are not the best models, what are the best models?¬†Thus I look at this, and I think those who claim inflation is ‚Äúout of control‚Äù are doing their audiences and their selves no good service‚Ä¶

	  Given a reward  and a deterministic episodic environment where episodes end with a ``generate '' action, how do we generate diverse and high-reward s?
	  We propose to use Flow Networks to model discrete  from which we can sample sequentially (like episodic RL, rather than iteratively as MCMC methods would). We show that our method, GFlowNet, is very useful on a combinatorial domain, drug molecule synthesis, because unlike RL methods it generates diverse s by design.

	          > The European Union‚Äôs top executive flew to¬†Budapest in a bid to break a deadlock on the bloc‚Äôs proposed oil embargo against Russia. Currently, Hungarian Prime Minister¬†Viktor Orban, who has remained friendly with the Kremlin despite its war on Ukraine, stands in the way. The EU¬†seems set to soften its sanctions package on Russian oil exports, though it aims to keep a key shipping provision that will hinder Moscow‚Äôs ability to sell¬†its crude. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin defied speculation that he might use an annual¬†military parade¬†to announce an escalation of¬†his¬†faltering offensive in Donbas.¬†As Putin¬†marked the 77th anniversary¬†of the allied defeat of Nazi Germany, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy slammed his attempt to use that war to defend Russian aggression that‚Äôs killed thousands of civilians through the bombing of residential areas and alleged mass executions. France‚Äôs Emmanuel Macron drew a different historical parallel, warning against humiliating Russia with a reference to Germany‚Äôs defeat in World War I‚Äîand the aftermath. Meanwhile, a Russian government forecast shows the nation faces its¬†deepest economic contraction¬†in almost three decades.¬†‚ÄîNatasha Solo-Lyons

Wade.¬†But on Wall Street, the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are mulling extending benefits to cover travel¬†for reproductive services, potentially joining Citigroup, Amazon and Uber¬†in similar efforts.¬†Republican lawmakers want to make such moves¬†expensive¬†for employers, however. More broadly, if the Republican-appointee dominated high court follows through on the draft opinion by Samuel Alito, the legal fallout could eventually endanger same-sex marriage and contraceptive rights. Closer aboard, such a ruling¬†may worsen what‚Äôs already one¬†of the highest rates¬†of maternal death¬†in childbirth of any developed nation. And politically, in a country where a clear majority favors the right to abortion,¬†such a decision is likely to further polarize¬†the coming midterm elections.

	          > The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed as authentic¬†a draft opinion¬†supported by five Republican-appointed justices that would overturn the landmark abortion rights case Roe v Wade, sending shockwaves¬†across the country. Published by Politico on Monday, the opinion‚Äîif it becomes final‚Äîwould be transformational for an already-riven America‚Äîlegally, politically and socially. Legal experts warned such a ruling¬†could be a wider threat¬†to other rights¬†and spell the end of gay marriage¬†and access to contraceptives. U.S. President Joe Biden pushed Congress to pass laws legalizing abortion‚Äîsomething Senate Republicans would almost certainly block. Millions of American women live in the two dozen states where abortion would likely be outlawed. Fallout from a ruling overturning Roe¬†may implicate other critical issues currently affecting American women: the U.S. ranks as one of the worst in the developed world for maternal mortality;¬†the nation has¬†no federal paid parental leave; and regular, affordable or subsidized childcare (as the Covid-19 pandemic exposed) remains a key reason why women are being forced out of the workforce. ‚ÄîMargaret Sutherlin

	          > Listen now | Yesterday we announced a new Wilco album‚ÄîCruel Country. It has 21 songs on it. ‚ÄúLeave them wanting less‚Äù, as we always say. Anyway, I thought it might be nice to share a second song, since there are so many of them. ‚ÄúFalling Apart (Right Now)‚Äù is the name of the one we shared yesterday with the announcement (in case you missed it). This one is going behind the paywall, and it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúCruel Country‚Äù, same as the album.

As has often been the case in wars like this one, it‚Äôs artillery that‚Äôs making the difference.¬†And that‚Äôs why the U.S. and other nations are putting so much emphasis on providing howitzers to Ukraine forces. Such traditional firepower, supported by drones that allow for pinpoint targeting, will become even more dominant in the¬†next phase of the war, along a 300-plus mile front in Donbas.

But Poland says it‚Äôs fully prepared for a cutoff of all energy supplies and has been outlining plans to live without Russian gas even before the war.

	          > Elon Musk is¬†buying Twitter¬†for $44 billion, using one of the biggest leveraged buyout deals in history to take the¬†16-year-old social media platform¬†private. Simultaneously, Musk is¬†raising a lot of questions about Twitter‚Äôs¬†future and that of his broader empire. While Twitter shares closed way up, Tesla shares fell on the news. One issue is what Musk will do with Twitter‚Äôs efforts to corral hate speech, Covid-19 misinformation and election manipulation of the kind Russia allegedly¬†attempted in 2016 and 2020? Which leads to¬†another question: will Musk reinstate Donald Trump‚Äôs account, suspended shortly after his followers violently sought to block the transfer of American power on Jan. 6, 2021? Though not directly related to ongoing investigations of his actions that day, on Monday Trump was found¬†in contempt of court¬†for failing to respond to subpoenas in a¬†New York investigation of his real estate company. The judge ordered the billionaire pay¬†a fine of $10,000 a day.¬†‚ÄîNatasha Solo-Lyons

	          > BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2022-04-25 Mo: A very nice piece by Mark Hertling on why we should have hopes for the Ukraine Army during its current turn in the Inferno:¬†Mark Hertling: ‚ÄôA few folks suggested I‚Äôve been ‚Äúbold‚Äù in some of my predictions..."¬†I had a brief piece on the complexity of war-as-a-profession two months ago:¬†Ibn Khaldun called it assibayah: understanding that it is your group, that you have a job to do in order for it to properly perform, and that your job requires the right kind of coordination. For most of history, a commander with assibayah handled logistics, inspiration, and delivered soldiers to the right battlefield; and soldiers with assibayah knew how to handle their weapons while protecting those standing next to them. And with assibayah, soldiers supplied who trusted their leader and found themselves on the right battlefield were nearly invincible. F‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî phalanx. F‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî legion. F‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî knights. F‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî longbowmen. F‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî pikemen. And, above all (usually), f‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî horse-archers.¬†But then, with the coming of personal firearms, it all became more complicated. It turned into rock ‚Üí paper ‚Üí scissors. Cavalry rode down musketeers. Musketeers rolled over pikemen. Pikemen drove off cavalry. And artillery was a joker that could break up the pike phalanx and disorder the other arms to render them combat ineffective‚Äîunless and until it was itself overrun. Tactical victory required combined arms, and the right kind of combined arms, so that their cavalry faced your pikemen, their pikemen faced your musketeers, and their musketeers were ridden down by your cavalry. As time passed, things became more complex.And in all of this, (fewer) professionals could easily defeat (more) amateurs. And professionals could be defeated by better professionals who understood the principles of combined-arms warfare better. How is it that Arthur Wellesley could win at, consecutively, Roli√ßa, Vimeiro, Oporto, Talavera, Bu√ßaco, Fuentes de Onoro, Salamanca, Vitoria, the Pyrenees, Bidassoa, Nivelle, Toulouse, and Waterloo? (Note, however, that his siege efforts were often unsuccessful.) As von Clausewitz wrote: ‚Äúwar is very simple, but the simplest thing is very difficult‚Äù.¬†How much does the Ukrainian Army really know what it is doing? And how much of that knowledge can be transmitted quickly to replacements? We can hope.¬†Note: The best single thing I have read on all of this is: Daniel P. Bolger: Dragons at War: 2-34 Infantry in the Mojave <https://archive.org/details/dragonsatwar234i0000bolg/>

Like portions of Ukraine‚Äôs Donbas region, separatists backed by Moscow‚Äôs soldiers hold sway in Transnistria.

Putin‚Äôs adjutants said more than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers¬†remain inside a massive steel¬†complex there, holding out in a¬†seemingly lost cause. Mariupol would be the biggest city taken by Russia so far in its botched war on Ukraine, but Ihor Zhovkva, deputy chief of Ukraine‚Äôs presidential staff, said it‚Äôs ‚Äúpremature‚Äù to say the city has fallen. Around 100,000 civilians remain there, with some hiding in bunkers inside the steel mill, according to Mayor Vadym Boychenko. Around 40,000 have been taken to Russia or territory it controls, he said. The mayor has previously accused Putin‚Äôs forces of trying to conceal civilian deaths by trucking corpses to mass graves west of the city.

The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee‚Äîwhich includes Goldman Sachs, Barclays and JPMorgan‚Äîsaid Wednesday that a ‚Äúpotential failure-to-pay‚Äù event occurred for credit-default swaps when Russia paid rubles after foreign banks declined to process U.S. currency transfers. If Russia doesn‚Äôt pay up in dollars by the time its¬†grace period expires¬†on May 4, it would be the country‚Äôs first default on external debt in more than a century. Holders of the swaps could then start the process of getting paid on contracts covering about $40 billion of debt.

	          > BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2022-04-20 We: What is the incoming flow of data teaching me, as I try to keep my view of the macroeconomic outlook marked to market?¬†In normal times, the gearing between the Federal Funds rate and the real Treasury 10-year rate is about 1/3: a 3%-point rise in the Federal Funds rate carries with it a 1%-point rise in the real Treasury 10-year rate. Since the start of this year, we have had an 0.25%-point rise in the Federal Funds rate, and aa 1%-point rise in the real Treasury 10-year rate‚Äînine times the standard gearing. Why? Because monetary policy is not just the current level of the Fed Funds rate, but is the current level plus all the forward guidance that gives the anticipated future path of the Fed Funds rate. In the shifts in monetary policy that you should pay attention to are not what the Fed does at its meetings, but rather the unexpected component of Fed actions, and the surrounding word cloud of communications that are the forward guidance.¬†If you thought at the start of this year that the Fed was behind the curve, and that it needed, through Fed-Funds rate increases and shifts in forward guidance, to do things with effects on long-term real interest rates that would be the equivalent of a 5%-point increase in the Fed Funds rate, then I have news for you: The Fed is 3/5 of the way there. If you thought, like me, that the costs of tightening too soon and being wrong were very high‚Äîthat the 2010s were a disaster, in which an √¶nemic secularly-stagnant economy grossly underperformed in employment and productivity growth, substantially because the Fed had let itself get trapped at the zero lower bound in nominal interest rates‚Äîthen the past four months should lead you to think that the Fed is, if anything, slightly ahead of the curve right now, and should stay its (currently planned) course of Fed-Funds interest-rate increases, rather than accelerate them. Rather than accelerate rate increases further, it should watch what changes in financial conditions over the past four months are about to do to the future of housing investment.¬†But one joker has been dealt: The 5/5 forward rate‚Äîwhat those trading in the bond market expect CPI inflation to be not over the next five years but over the five years after that‚Äîis now trading at the very top of what has become the normal range. If the 5/5 rate moves higher, it will be a sign that the bond market no longer trusts the Fed to maintain inflation at or below its target over the long run. That would be a sign that the economy‚Äôs inflation anchor is not lost, but starting to drag. And that would be a powerful piece of information suggesting that the Fed should accelerate its tightening cycle a notch.¬†Overall, however, I am still on Team The-Fed-Has-Got-This, and Team This-Is-Not-Like-the‚Äì1970s-at-All.

After having pulled back from the north of the country following a failed effort to take the capital and other major cities, the Kremlin has been steadily moving forces to the Donbas region. With wide-ranging tank battles expected across the area‚Äôs open landscape, this new chapter of Russia‚Äôs war comes with an advantage for the Kremlin: separatist groups have been fighting the Ukrainian military there (with Moscow‚Äôs help) since 2014. Critical to any move by Russia to establish a land corridor along the Sea of Azov will be Mariupol, the port city it‚Äôs been¬†pounding for weeks.¬†Its remaining defenders are encircled but haven‚Äôt surrendered, Ukrainian officials said.¬†In recent days, Russian forces also renewed  their barrage on cities all across the country, including strikes on what it claims are arms depots in Lviv, near the border with Poland.

And that requirement for how to live a comfortable life‚Äîit, to say the least, profoundly marked humanity and its history.¬†Now and in the future‚Äîsince 2010‚Äîhowever, we are rich enough‚Äîtechnology is advanced enough, growth is fast enough, and women have other ways of gaining social power than being the mothers of sons enough that Malthusian pressures no longer keep us so poor‚Äîthat we can all lead comfortable lives, in the sense that it is straightforward to produce enough, so our collective economic problems are ones of distributing the enough and of using it appropriately to make us happy rather than miserable.¬†In between 1870 and 2010‚Äîduring the long 20th century‚Äîthings were both marvelous and terrible, but in the context of previous human history more marvelous than terrible...

	          > Unsatisfied with just being Twitter‚Äôs largest investor and one of its most followed users, the world‚Äôs richest man now wants to buy the company outright. Elon Musk told the board¬†he thinks Twitter¬†isn‚Äôt meeting its free speech ‚Äúsocietal imperative‚Äù and should become a private company.¬† But as¬†Timothy O‚ÄôBrien notes in Bloomberg Opinion, Musk‚Äôs aim isn‚Äôt freedom of expression¬†but control.¬†Adding to the attention: A Twitter shareholder sued¬†Musk (who already has a Plan B). For its part, Twitter adopted a poison pill to thwart any hostile takeover bids. Meanwhile, company founder¬†Jack Dorsey has ascended to the rank¬†of¬†Bitcoin spiritual adviser.

			- Sri Lanka was downgraded deeper into junk by Fitch to CC, one step above default. Earlier, S&amp;P also cut its score to CC, the third-lowest level. The government said Tuesday it will no longer service external debts to conserve foreign currency for crucial imports, such as fuel, as the country is rattled by power cuts, food shortages and a currency in free fall. There have been mounting calls for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, to resign. So far,  China has yet to respond to Sri Lanka‚Äôs pleas for $2.5 billion in credit support.

	          > Spurred by Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine and continuing economic fallout from the pandemic, U.S. inflation rose in March by the most since late 1981, reinforcing pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates¬†more aggressively.¬†The main sources of pain during the month were gasoline and food. Though some¬†economic experts contend the current inflation reading of 8.5% is¬†likely its peak, the path down the mountain can‚Äôt come soon enough for many consumers. That said, when excluding volatile food and energy components, so-called core prices increased just 0.3% from a month earlier, due in large part to the biggest drop in used vehicle prices since 1969 and a price deceleration in other categories.¬†Used car prices, which had been a driver of higher goods inflation for months, were down 3.8% in March, the second straight monthly decline.¬†The figures are ‚Äúa welcome respite from the sustained heated core increases of late, and fuel costs look to ease in response to the recent pullback in oil prices,‚Äù Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note. But he warned that rent and food will be problems for longer. Here‚Äôs your  markets wrap.¬†‚ÄîMargaret Sutherlin

While¬†sanctions¬†have undoubtedly hurt Russia‚Äôs economy, energy exports are still¬†helping prop up its¬†finances. European energy companies have also found a loophole to appease public opinion, Javier Blas writes in¬†Bloomberg Opinion.¬†The ruble, mocked by U.S. President Joe Biden as ‚Äúrubble,‚Äù¬†has surged¬†back to where it was before the war‚Äîthough there‚Äôs a big caveat. Still, sanctions may continue to fall short as long they don‚Äôt interrupt Russia‚Äôs fossil fuel industry.

	          > German intelligence reportedly intercepted radio exchanges between Russian soldiers who discussed killing Ukrainian civilians outside Kyiv, potentially leveling a powerful retort to widely dismissed Russian claims that massacres in Bucha and elsewhere were ‚Äústaged.‚Äù¬†The German information indicated that Russia‚Äôs Wagner Group, a mercenary firm tied to the Kremlin, may have been involved in the atrocities. Some eyewitnesses claimed Chechens were among them as well, Der Spiegel¬†magazine reported. German officials, who presented the intelligence to lawmakers in Berlin Wednesday, say the intercepts indicate that the murder of civilians in the town of Bucha was not an act by rogue forces, but may have been part of a deliberate strategy to foment terror.

	  Best practices for building secure API Keys
	  We all know how valuable APIs are. They‚Äôre the gateway to exploring other
	  services, integrating with them, and building great solutions faster.
	  
	  You might have built or are thinking of building APIs for other developers to

Shelling of Ukrainian cities continued overnight while the Russian government formally called up more than 134,000 conscripts as part of its annual draft. Kremlin forces are pulling back from at least one area, however. Russian soldiers are leaving the site of the doomed Chernobyl nuclear plant after Ukrainian authorities said some of them¬†received significant doses of radiation.

	          > On Tuesday, Russia announced it would pull back forces from around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv¬†and alluded to positive developments in peace talks. On Wednesday, Russia  attacked¬†the area around Kyiv and said there was no ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù in peace talks. In between these apparently contradictory moves, the U.S. and its NATO allies had expressed deep skepticism about Russian motivations for (let alone promises of) ‚Äúde-escalation.‚Äù The wariness seemed to be borne out as civilians in villages and towns in northern Ukraine reportedly came under fire by Kremlin forces just as they were expecting a respite from the violence. As Russia continues to say it is moving¬†troops east to Donbas, U.S. intelligence contends¬†news of both the botched invasion and losses to Ukrainian defenders may not be  making it¬†all the way to Vladimir Putin‚Äôs ears.

	          > The Kremlin says it‚Äôs pulling back some of its troops around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv as cease-fire talks in Turkey appear¬†to yield some progress. Those developments, however,¬†came as Ukrainian officials warn Vladimir Putin is simply looking to cut his losses after a month-long invasion that failed to take a major city and reportedly cost him thousands of dead soldiers. After largely destroying¬†some of those cities while killing hundreds¬†if not thousands¬†of civilians, the announced ‚Äúde-escalation‚Äù is being seen in some quarters as merely a tactic as Putin consolidates gains in the east and tries to establish a land corridor with Ukraine‚Äôs occupied Crimean peninsula.

Despite reports that the Kremlin is moving to consolidate gains in the east, cities across Ukraine are still being pounded by Russian artillery.

The relationship between Beijing and Moscow¬†has become more complicated, but experts¬†doubt there will be a rupture in the flow of oil and coal.¬†Energy is just one example of how Russia‚Äôs¬†war on Ukraine ‚Äúcould mark a lasting change in the way the world economy works,‚Äù John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge¬†write¬†in Bloomberg Opinion, unless the West is wise enough to remake the global order.

	          > The U.S. and the European Union will¬†push to boost supplies of liquefied natural gas to European countries by the end of 2022 in a bid to displace some Russian gas. Under the agreement, Europe will get at least 15 billion cubic meters of additional LNG supplies by the end of the year, though it‚Äôs not clear where it will come from. Member states will also work to ensure demand and facilities to take in as much as 50 billion cubic meters of American fuel until at least 2030. The aim of course is to help the continent wean itself off Russian gas, which accounts for about 40% of Europe‚Äôs needs, while further putting the screws to the Kremlin over its war on Ukraine.¬†‚ÄúWe‚Äôre coming together to reduce Europe‚Äôs dependence on Russian energy,‚Äù U.S. President Joe Biden said at a joint press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who added that 15 billion cubic meters this year ‚Äúis a big step in that direction.‚Äù Still, when compared to how much energy Russia currently sells Europe, they have¬†a very long way to go

NATO said Wednesday it would add more battlegroups including thousands more troops¬†on its eastern flank¬†and pledged to help¬†Ukraine¬†if Putin (as U.S. intelligence has warned he might) uses weapons of mass destruction. ‚ÄúAny use of chemical weapons would totally change the nature of the conflict,‚Äù NATO Secretary General Jens Stolenberg warned.¬†The U.S. has repeatedly said that Moscow may be planning to stage a ‚Äúfalse flag‚Äù event as pretext to use such weapons, a strategy the Kremlin was accused of trying out before launching its war one month ago. On the  economic front, Putin is trying to leverage the energy market to his advantage, demanding so-called unfriendly nations pay for gas in Russian rubles. The move has the potential to aggravate Europe‚Äôs worst energy crunch since the 1970s. The European Union has said it would continue to¬†tighten sanctions against Russia, but given its reliance on Russia for fossil fuel, wouldn‚Äôt include energy. That said, the EU and the U.S. are close to a deal aimed at slashing Europe‚Äôs dependence on Russian energy.¬†‚ÄîMargaret Sutherlin

It comes amid continued Russian aggression and growing concerns about a spiraling humanitarian disaster.¬†Russian forces destroyed an atomic-physics lab under international safeguards in Ukraine‚Äôs second-largest city, the head of the world‚Äôs nuclear watchdog said, underscoring growing safety concerns over fighting around the country‚Äôs facilities.

A Ukrainian delegation led by the defense minister agreed to further talks after meeting with Russian officials on the border with Belarus. But at the same time, the Ukrainian government was reporting a   rising number of civilian deaths at the hands of Russia‚Äôs military as residential areas increasingly come under fire. At home, Putin is paying a high economic price for his war.¬†A wall of western sanctions targeting Russian banks, companies and individuals led to a collapse in the ruble and prompted the central bank to impose capital controls to allay investor panic. The bank¬†more than doubled its key interest rate to 20%.

Ukrainian authorities said about 140 people have been killed¬†and told residents to ‚Äúprepare Molotov cocktails‚Äù to defend against Russian soldiers.

In a televised address, Biden announced sanctions over the decision by Vladimir Putin to send more troops into two so-called¬†separatist republics inside Ukraine, and said the move sets the stage for a larger-scale invasion. Kremlin forces already occupy Ukraine‚Äôs Crimean peninsula. In coordination with European allies and others, the U.S. said it‚Äôs implementing a first round of sanctions, effectively cutting Moscow off from Western financing. Biden added he would announce other targeted sanctions against Russian oligarchs and their families in the coming days. Germany halted the  Nord Stream 2 pipeline, one of Putin‚Äôs biggest priorities, and the U.K. announced additional sanctions targeting banks.

The spike highlights¬†a steady appetite for merchandise such as cars and furniture, and might suggest consumers are buying¬†big-ticket items before interest rates rise. It‚Äôs a boon for Walmart, which   bucked pandemic-induced supply chain issues, labor shortfalls and rising prices to post higher-than-expected quarterly profit. ‚ÄúWalmart has a cart full of reasons to love inflation,‚Äù writes¬†Andrea Felsted in¬†Bloomberg Opinion.

The U.S. said Russia¬†has massed as many as 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine, including Russian-backed separatists, in what it called the most significant military mobilization since World War II. Leaders of separatist forces in Ukraine‚Äôs east have said they are sending children, women and elderly to Russia, a move NATO allies said may presage a false-flag event to cover a Russian invasion (Moscow has denied planning either action, or a massive cyberattack this week the U.S. contends the Kremlin was behind). The Ukrainian military said the rebels have accelerated shelling along the so-called contact line while the rebels accused¬†the military of attacking them, which Kyiv has denied. In addition to conventional, live-fire exercises with Belarus along Ukraine‚Äôs northern border, Vladimir Putin has ordered drills of Russia‚Äôs strategic nuclear forces this weekend, including ballistic and cruise-missile launches.
